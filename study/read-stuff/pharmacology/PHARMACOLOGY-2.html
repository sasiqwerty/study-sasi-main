<h2 id="ii-drug-development--regulation">II DRUG DEVELOPMENT &amp; REGULATION</h2>
<p>A truly new drug (one that does not simply mimic the structure and action of previously available drugs) requires the discovery of a new drug target, ie, the pathophysiologic process or substrate of a disease. Such discoveries are usually made in public sector institutions (universities and research institutes), and molecules that have beneficial effects on such targets are often discovered in the same laboratories. However, the development of new drugs usually takes place in industrial laboratories because optimization of a class of new drugs requires painstaking and expensive chemical, pharmacologic, and toxicologic research. In fact, much of the recent progress in the application of drugs to disease problems can be ascribed to the pharmaceutical industry including “big pharma,” the multibilliondollar corporations that specialize in drug development and marketing. These companies are uniquely skilled in translating basic findings into successful therapeutic breakthroughs and profit-making “blockbusters”.</p>
<p>Such breakthroughs come at a price, however, and the escalating cost of drugs has become a significant contributor to the inflationary increase in the cost of health care. Development of new drugs is enormously expensive, but considerable controversy surrounds drug pricing. Critics claim that the costs of development and marketing are grossly inflated by marketing activities, advertising, and other promotional efforts, which may consume as much as 25% or more of a company’s budget. Furthermore, profit margins for big pharma are relatively high. Recent drug-pricing scandals have been reported in which the right to an older, established drug has been purchased by a smaller company and the price increased by several hundred or several thousand percent. This “price gouging” has caused public outrage and attracted regulatory attention that may result in more legitimate and rational pricing mechanisms. Finally, pricing schedules for many drugs vary dramatically from country to country and even within countries, where large organizations can negotiate favorable prices and small ones cannot. Some countries have already addressed these inequities, and it seems likely that all countries will have to do so during the next few decades.</p>
<h3 id="new-drug-development">NEW DRUG DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p>The development of a new drug usually begins with the discovery or synthesis of a potential new drug compound or the elucidation of a new drug target. After a new drug molecule is synthesized or extracted from a natural source, subsequent steps seek an understanding of the drug’s interactions with its biologic targets. Repeated application of this approach leads to synthesis of related compounds with increased efficacy, potency, and selectivity (Figure 1–6). In the United States, the safety and efficacy of drugs must be established before marketing can be legally carried out. In addition to in vitro studies, relevant biologic effects, drug metabolism, pharmacokinetic profiles, and relative safety of the drug must be characterized in vivo in animals before human drug trials can be started. With regulatory approval, human testing may then go forward (usually in three phases) before the drug is considered for approval for general use. A fourth phase of data gathering and safety monitoring is becoming increasingly important and follows after approval for marketing. Once approved, the great majority of drugs become available for use by any appropriately licensed practitioner. Highly toxic drugs that are nevertheless considered valuable in lethal diseases may be approved for restricted use by practitioners who have undergone special training in their use and who maintain detailed records.</p>
<p><img src="/images/p26.png" alt="image"></p>
<h3 id="drug-discovery">DRUG DISCOVERY</h3>
<p>Most new drugs or drug products are discovered or developed through the following approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>screening for biologic activity of large numbers of natural products, banks of previously discovered chemical entities, or large libraries of peptides, nucleic acids, and other organic molecules;</li>
<li>chemical modification of a known active molecule, resulting in a “me-too” analog;</li>
<li>identification or elucidation of a new drug target; and</li>
<li>rational design of a new molecule based on an understanding of biologic mechanisms and drug receptor structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps (3) and (4) are often carried out in academic research laboratories and are more likely to lead to breakthrough drugs, but the costs of steps (1) and (2) usually ensure that industry carries them out. Once a new drug target or promising molecule has been identified, the process of moving from the basic science laboratory to the clinic begins. This translational research involves the preclinical and clinical steps, described next. While clinical trials in humans are required only for drugs to be used in humans, all of the other steps described apply to veterinary drugs as well as drugs for human diseases.</p>
<h4 id="drug-screening">Drug Screening</h4>
<p>Drug screening involves a variety of assays at the molecular, cellular, organ system, and whole animal levels to define the pharmacologic profile, ie, the activity and selectivity of the drug. The type and number of initial screening tests depend on the pharmacologic and therapeutic goal. For example, anti-infective drugs are tested against a variety of infectious organisms, some of which are resistant to standard agents; hypoglycemic drugs are tested for their ability to lower blood sugar, etc.</p>
<p>The molecule is also studied for a broad array of other actions to determine the mechanism of action and selectivity of the drug. This can reveal both expected and unexpected toxic effects. Occasionally, an unexpected therapeutic action is serendipitously discovered by a careful observer; for example, the era of modern diuretics was initiated by the observation that certain antimicrobial sulfonamides caused metabolic acidosis. The selection of compounds for development is most efficiently conducted in animal models of human disease. Where good predictive preclinical models exist (eg, infection, hypertension, or thrombotic disease), we generally have good or excellent drugs. Good drugs or breakthrough improvements are conspicuously lacking and slow for diseases for which preclinical models are poor or not yet available, eg, autism and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>At the molecular level, the compound would be screened for activity on the target, for example, receptor binding affinity to cell membranes containing the homologous animal receptors (or if possible, on the cloned human receptors). Early studies would be done to predict effects that might later cause undesired drug metabolism or toxicologic complications. For example, studies on liver cytochrome P450 enzymes would be performed to determine whether the molecule of interest is likely to be a substrate or inhibitor of these enzymes or to alter the metabolism of other drugs.</p>
<p>Effects on cell function determine whether the drug is an agonist, partial agonist, inverse agonist, or antagonist at relevant receptors. Isolated tissues would be used to characterize the pharmacologic activity and selectivity of the new compound in comparison with reference compounds. Comparison with other drugs would also be undertaken in a variety of in vivo studies. At each step in this process, the compound would have to meet specific performance and selectivity criteria to be carried further.</p>
<p>Whole animal studies are generally necessary to determine the effect of the drug on organ systems and disease models. Cardiovascular and renal function studies of new drugs are generally first performed in normal animals. Studies on disease models, if available, are then performed. For a candidate antihypertensive drug, animals with hypertension would be treated to see whether blood pressure was lowered in a dose-related manner and to characterize other effects of the compound. Evidence would be collected on duration of action and efficacy after oral and parenteral administration. If the agent possessed useful activity, it would be further studied for possible adverse effects on other organs, including the respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, endocrine, and central nervous systems.</p>
<p>These studies might suggest the need for further chemical modification (compound optimization) to achieve more desirable pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties. For example, oral administration studies might show that the drug was poorly absorbed or rapidly metabolized in the liver; modification to improve bioavailability might be indicated. If the drug was to be administered long term, an assessment of tolerance development would be made. For drugs related to or having mechanisms of action similar to those known to cause physical or psychological dependence in humans, ability to cause dependence in animals would also be studied. Drug interactions would be examined.</p>
<p>The desired result of this screening procedure (which may have to be repeated several times with congeners of the original molecule) is a lead compound, ie, a leading candidate for a successful new drug. A patent application would be filed for a novel compound (a composition of matter patent) that is efficacious, or for a new and non-obvious therapeutic use (a use patent) for a previously known chemical entity.</p>
<h3 id="preclinical-safety--toxicity-testing">PRECLINICAL SAFETY &amp; TOXICITY TESTING</h3>
<p>All chemicals are toxic in some individuals at some dose. Candidate drugs that survive the initial screening procedures must be carefully evaluated for potential risks before and during clinical testing. Depending on the proposed use of the drug, preclinical toxicity testing includes most or all of the procedures shown in Table 1–4. Although no chemical can be certified as completely “safe” (free of risk), the objective is to estimate the risk associated with exposure to the drug candidate and to consider this in the context of therapeutic needs and likely duration of drug use. The goals of preclinical toxicity studies include identifying potential human toxicities, designing tests to further define the toxic mechanisms, and predicting the most relevant toxicities to be monitored in clinical trials. In addition to the studies shown in Table 1–4, several quantitative estimates are desirable. These include the no-effect dose—the maximum dose at which a specified toxic effect is not seen; the minimum lethal dose—the smallest dose that is observed to kill any experimental animal; and, if necessary, the median lethal dose (LD50)—the dose that kills approximately 50% of the animals in a test group. Presently, the LD50 is estimated from the smallest number of animals possible. These doses are used to calculate the initial dose to be tried in humans, usually taken as one hundredth to one tenth of the no-effect dose in animals. It is important to recognize the limitations of preclinical testing. These include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Toxicity testing is time-consuming and expensive. Two to 6 years may be required to collect and analyze data on toxicity before the drug can be considered ready for testing in humans.</li>
<li>Large numbers of animals may be needed to obtain valid preclinical data. Scientists are properly concerned about this situation, and progress has been made toward reducing the numbers required while still obtaining valid data. Cell and tissue culture in vitro methods and computer modeling are increasingly being used, but their predictive value is still limited. Nevertheless, some segments of the public attempt to halt all animal testing in the unfounded belief that it has become unnecessary.</li>
<li>Extrapolations of toxicity data from animals to humans are reasonably predictive for many but not for all toxicities.</li>
<li>For statistical reasons, rare adverse effects are unlikely to be detected in preclinical testing.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="evaluation-in-humans">EVALUATION IN HUMANS</h3>
<p>A very small fraction of lead compounds reach clinical trials, and less than one third of the drugs studied in humans survive clinical trials and reach the marketplace. Federal law in the USA and ethical considerations require that the study of new drugs in humans be conducted in accordance with stringent guidelines. Scientifically valid results are not guaranteed simply by conforming to government regulations, however, and the design and execution of a good clinical trial require interdisciplinary personnel including basic scientists, clinical pharmacologists, clinician specialists, statisticians, and others. The need for careful design and execution is based on three major confounding factors inherent in the study of any drug in humans.</p>
<h4 id="confounding-factors-in-clinical-trials">Confounding Factors in Clinical Trials</h4>
<p><strong>The Variable Natural History of Most Diseases</strong></p>
<p>Many diseases tend to wax and wane in severity; some disappear spontaneously, even, on occasion, cancer. A good experimental design takes into account the natural history of the disease by evaluating a large enough population of subjects over a sufficient period of time. Further protection against errors of interpretation caused by disease fluctuations is sometimes provided by using a crossover design, which consists of alternating periods of administration of test drug, placebo preparation (the control), and the standard treatment (positive control), if any, in each subject. These sequences are systematically varied, so that different subsets of patients receive each of the possible sequences of treatment.</p>
<p><strong>The Presence of Other Diseases and Risk Factors</strong></p>
<p>Known and unknown diseases and risk factors (including lifestyles of subjects) may influence the results of a clinical study. For example, some diseases alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs (see Chapters 3 through 5). Other drugs and some foods alter the pharmacokinetics of many drugs. Concentrations of blood or tissue components being monitored as a measure of the effect of the new agent may be influenced by other diseases or other drugs. Attempts to avoid this hazard usually involve the crossover technique (when feasible) and proper selection and assignment of patients to each of the study groups. This requires obtaining accurate diagnostic tests and medical and pharmacologic histories (including use of recreational drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and “supplements”) and the use of statistically valid methods of randomization in assigning subjects to particular study groups. There is growing interest in analyzing genetic variations as part of the trial that may influence whether a person responds to a particular drug. It has been shown that age, gender, and pregnancy influence the pharmacokinetics of some drugs, but these factors have not been adequately studied because of legal restrictions and reluctance to expose these populations to unknown risks.</p>
<p><strong>Subject and Observer Bias and Other Factors</strong></p>
<p>Most patients tend to respond in a positive way to any therapeutic intervention by interested, caring, and enthusiastic medical personnel. The manifestation of this phenomenon in the subject is the placebo response (Latin, “I shall please”) and may involve objective physiologic and biochemical changes as well as changes in subjective complaints associated with the disease. The placebo response is usually quantitated by administration of an inert material with exactly the same physical appearance, odor, consistency, etc, as the active dosage form. The magnitude of the response varies considerably from patient to patient and may also be influenced by the duration of the study. In some conditions, a positive response may be noted in as many as 30–40% of subjects given placebo. Placebo adverse effects and “toxicity” also occur but usually involve subjective effects: stomach upset, insomnia, sedation, and so on. Subject bias effects can be quantitated—and minimized relative to the response measured during active therapy—by the single-blind design. This involves use of a placebo as described above, administered to the same subjects in a crossover design, if possible, or to a separate control group of well-matched subjects. Observer bias can be taken into account by disguising the identity of the medication being used—placebo or active form—from both the subjects and the personnel evaluating the subjects’ responses (double-blind design). In this design, a third party holds the code identifying each medication packet, and the code is not broken until all the clinical data have been collected. Drug effects seen in clinical trials are obviously affected by the patient taking the drugs at the dose and frequency prescribed. In a recent phase 2 study, one third of the patients who said they were taking the drug were found by blood analysis to have not taken the drug. Confirmation of compliance with protocols (also known as adherence) is a necessary element to consider. The various types of studies and the conclusions that may be drawn from them are described in the accompanying text box. (See Box: Drug Studies—The Types of Evidence.)</p>
<h4 id="the-food--drug-administration">The Food &amp; Drug Administration</h4>
<p>The FDA is the administrative body that oversees the drug evaluation process in the USA and grants approval for marketing of new drug products. To receive FDA approval for marketing, the originating institution or company (almost always the latter) must submit evidence of safety and effectiveness. Outside the USA, the regulatory and drug approval process is generally similar to that in the USA.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, the FDA is also responsible for certain aspects of food safety, a role it shares with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Shared responsibility results in complications when questions arise regarding the use of drugs, eg, antibiotics, in food animals. A different type of problem arises when so-called food supplements are found to contain active drugs, eg, sildenafil analogs in “energy food” supplements. The FDA’s authority to regulate drugs derives from specific legislation (Table 1–5). If a drug has not been shown through adequately controlled testing to be “safe and effective” for a specific use, it cannot be marketed in interstate commerce for this use.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, “safe” can mean different things to the patient, the physician, and society. Complete absence of risk is impossible to demonstrate, but this fact may not be understood by members of the public, who frequently assume that any medication sold with the approval of the FDA should be free of serious “side effects.” This confusion is a major factor in litigation and dissatisfaction with aspects of drugs and medical care.</p>
<p>The history of drug regulation in the USA (Table 1–5) reflects several health events that precipitated major shifts in public opinion. For example, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 was largely a reaction to deaths associated with the use of a preparation of sulfanilamide marketed before it and its vehicle were adequately tested. Similarly, the Kefauver-Harris Amendments of 1962 were, in part, the result of a teratogenic drug disaster involving thalidomide. This agent was introduced in Europe in 1957–1958 and was marketed as a “nontoxic” hypnotic and promoted as being especially useful as a sleep aid during pregnancy. In 1961, reports were published suggesting that thalidomide was responsible for a dramatic increase in the incidence of a rare birth defect called phocomelia, a condition involving shortening or complete absence of the arms and legs. Epidemiologic studies provided strong evidence for the association of this defect with thalidomide use by women during the first trimester of pregnancy, and the drug was withdrawn from sale worldwide. An estimated 10,000 children were born with birth defects because of maternal exposure to this one agent. The tragedy led to the requirement for more extensive testing of new drugs for teratogenic effects and stimulated passage of the Kefauver-Harris Amendments of 1962, even though the drug was not then approved for use in the USA. Despite its disastrous fetal toxicity and effects in pregnancy, thalidomide is a relatively safe drug for humans other than the fetus. Even the most serious risk of toxicities may be avoided or managed if understood, and despite its toxicity, thalidomide is now approved by the FDA for limited use as a potent immuno-regulatory agent and to treat certain forms of leprosy.</p>
<h4 id="clinical-trials-the-ind--nda">Clinical Trials: The IND &amp; NDA</h4>
<p>Once a new drug is judged ready to be studied in humans, a Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Drug (IND) must be filed with the FDA (Figure 1–6). The IND includes</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) information on the composition and source of the drug,</li>
<li>(2) chemical and manufacturing information,</li>
<li>(3) all data from animal studies,</li>
<li>(4) proposed plans for clinical trials,</li>
<li>(5) the names and credentials of physicians who will conduct the clinical trials, and</li>
<li>(6) a compilation of the key preclinical data relevant to study of the drug in humans that have been made available to investigators and their institutional review boards.</li>
</ul>
<p>It often requires 4–6 years of clinical testing to accumulate and analyze all required data. Testing in humans is begun only after sufficient acute and subacute animal toxicity studies have been completed. Chronic safety testing in animals, including carcinogenicity studies, is usually done concurrently with clinical trials. In each phase of the clinical trials, volunteers or patients must be informed of the investigational status of the drug as well as the possible risks and must be allowed to decline or to consent to participate and receive the drug. In addition to the approval of the sponsoring organization and the FDA, an interdisciplinary institutional review board (IRB) at each facility where the clinical drug trial will be conducted must review and approve the scientific and ethical plans for testing in humans.</p>
<p>In phase 1, the effects of the drug as a function of dosage are established in a small number (20–100) of healthy volunteers. If the drug is expected to have significant toxicity, as may be the case in cancer and AIDS therapy, volunteer patients with the disease participate in phase 1 rather than normal volunteers. Phase 1 trials are done to determine the probable limits of the safe clinical dosage range. These trials may be non-blind or “open”; that is, both the investigators and the subjects know what is being given. Alternatively, they may be “blinded” and placebo controlled. Many predictable toxicities are detected in this phase. Pharmacokinetic measurements of absorption, half-life, and metabolism are often done. Phase 1 studies are usually performed in research centers by specially trained clinical pharmacologists.</p>
<p>In phase 2, the drug is studied in patients with the target disease to determine its efficacy (“proof of concept”), and the doses to be used in any follow-on trials. A modest number of patients (100–200) are studied in detail. A single-blind design may be used, with an inert placebo medication and an established active drug (positive control) in addition to the investigational agent. Phase 2 trials are usually done in special clinical centers (eg, university hospitals). A broader range of toxicities may be detected in this phase. Phase 2 trials have the highest rate of drug failures, and only 25% of innovative drugs move on to phase 3.</p>
<p>In phase 3, the drug is evaluated in much larger numbers of patients with the target disease—usually thousands—to further establish and confirm safety and efficacy. Using information gathered in phases 1 and 2, phase 3 trials are designed to minimize errors caused by placebo effects, variable course of the disease, etc. Therefore, double-blind and crossover techniques are often used. Phase 3 trials are usually performed in settings similar to those anticipated for the ultimate use of the drug. Phase 3 studies can be difficult to design and execute and are usually expensive because of the large numbers of patients involved and the masses of data that must be collected and analyzed. The drug is formulated as intended for the market. The investigators are usually specialists in the disease being treated. Certain toxic effects, especially those caused by immunologic processes, may first become apparent in phase 3.</p>
<p>If phase 3 results meet expectations, application is made for permission to market the new agent. Marketing approval requires submission of a New Drug Application (NDA)—or for biologicals, a Biological License Application (BLA)—to the FDA. The application contains, often in hundreds of volumes, full reports of all preclinical and clinical data pertaining to the drug under review. The number of subjects studied in support of the new drug application has been increasing and currently averages more than 5000 patients for new drugs of novel structure (new molecular entities). The duration of the FDA review leading to approval (or denial) of the new drug application may vary from months to years. If problems arise, eg, unexpected but possibly serious toxicities, additional studies may be required and the approval process may extend to several additional years.</p>
<p>Many phase 2 and phase 3 studies attempt to measure a new drug’s “non-inferiority” to the placebo or a standard treatment. Interpretation of the results may be difficult because of unexpected confounding variables, loss of subjects from some groups, or realization that results differ markedly between certain subgroups within the active treatment (new drug) group. Older statistical methods for evaluating drug trials often fail to provide definitive answers when these problems arise. Therefore, new “adaptive” statistical methods are under development that allow changes in the study design when interim data evaluation indicates the need. Preliminary results with such methods suggest that they may allow decisions regarding superiority as well as non-inferiority, shortening of trial duration, discovery of new therapeutic benefits, and more reliable conclusions regarding the results (see Bhatt &amp; Mehta, 2016).</p>
<p>In cases of urgent need (eg, cancer chemotherapy), the process of preclinical and clinical testing and FDA review may be accelerated. For serious diseases, the FDA may permit extensive but controlled marketing of a new drug before phase 3 studies are completed; for life-threatening diseases, it may permit controlled marketing even before phase 2 studies have been completed. “Fast track,” “priority approval,” and “accelerated approval” are FDA programs that are intended to speed entry of new drugs into the marketplace. In 2012, an additional special category of “breakthrough” products (eg, for cystic fibrosis) was approved for restricted marketing after expanded phase 1 trials (Table 1–5). Roughly 50% of drugs in phase 3 trials involve early, controlled marketing. Such accelerated approval is usually granted with the requirement that careful monitoring of the effectiveness and toxicity of the drug be carried out and reported to the FDA. Unfortunately, FDA enforcement of this requirement has not always been adequate.</p>
<p>Once approval to market a drug has been obtained, phase 4 begins. This constitutes monitoring the safety of the new drug under actual conditions of use in large numbers of patients. The importance of careful and complete reporting of toxicity by physicians after marketing begins can be appreciated by noting that many important drug-induced effects have an incidence of 1 in 10,000 or less and that some adverse effects may become apparent only after chronic dosing. The sample size required to disclose drug-induced events or toxicities is very large for such rare events. For example, several hundred thousand patients may have to be exposed before the first case is observed of a toxicity that occurs with an average incidence of 1 in 10,000. Therefore, low-incidence drug effects are not generally detected before phase 4 no matter how carefully phase 1, 2, and 3 studies are executed. Phase 4 has no fixed duration. As with monitoring of drugs granted accelerated approval, phase 4 monitoring has often been lax.</p>
<p>The time from the filing of a patent application to approval for marketing of a new drug may be 5 years or considerably longer. Since the lifetime of a patent is 20 years in the USA, the owner of the patent (usually a pharmaceutical company) has exclusive rights for marketing the product for only a limited time after approval of the new drug application. Because the FDA review process can be lengthy (300–500 days for evaluation of an NDA), the time consumed by the review is sometimes added to the patent life. However, the extension (up to 5 years) cannot increase the total life of the patent to more than 14 years after approval of a new drug application. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 provides for 12 years of patent protection for new drugs. After expiration of the patent, any company may produce the drug, file an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), demonstrate required equivalence, and, with FDA approval, market the drug as a generic product without paying license fees to the original patent owner. Currently, more than half of prescriptions in the USA are for generic drugs. Even biotechnology-based drugs such as antibodies and other proteins are now qualifying for generic (“biosimilar”) designation, and this has fueled regulatory concerns. More information on drug patents is available at the FDA website at <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/</a> ucm079031.htm.</p>
<p>A trademark is a drug’s proprietary trade name and is usually registered; this registered name may be legally protected as long as it is used. A generically equivalent product, unless specially licensed, cannot be sold under the trademark name and is often designated by the official generic name. Generic prescribing is described in Chapter 65.</p>
<h4 id="conflicts-of-interest">Conflicts of Interest</h4>
<p>Several factors in the development and marketing of drugs result in conflicts of interest. Use of pharmaceutical industry funding to support FDA approval processes raises the possibility of conflicts of interest within the FDA. Supporters of this policy point out that chronic FDA underfunding by the government allows for few alternatives. Another important source of conflicts of interest is the dependence of the FDA on outside panels of experts who are recruited from the scientific and clinical community to advise the government agency on questions regarding drug approval or withdrawal. Such experts are often recipients of grants from the companies producing the drugs in question. The need for favorable data in the new drug application leads to phase 2 and 3 trials in which the new agent is compared only to placebo, not to older, effective drugs. As a result, data regarding the efficacy and toxicity of the new drug relative to a known effective agent may not be available when the new drug is first marketed. Manufacturers promoting a new agent may pay physicians to use it in preference to older drugs with which they are more familiar.</p>
<p>Manufacturers sponsor small and often poorly designed clinical studies after marketing approval and aid in the publication of favorable results but may retard publication of unfavorable results. The need for physicians to meet continuing medical education (CME) requirements in order to maintain their licenses encourages manufacturers to sponsor conferences and courses, often in highly attractive vacation sites, and new drugs are often featured in such courses. Finally, the common practice of distributing free samples of new drugs to practicing physicians has both positive and negative effects. The samples allow physicians to try out new drugs without incurring any cost to the patient. On the other hand, new drugs are usually much more expensive than older agents, and when the free samples run out, the patient (or insurance carrier) may be forced to pay much more for treatment than if the older, cheaper, and possibly equally effective drug were used. Finally, when the patent for a drug is nearing expiration, the patent-holding manufacturer may try to extend its exclusive marketing status by paying generic manufacturers to not introduce a generic version (“pay to delay”).</p>
<h4 id="adverse-drug-reactions">Adverse Drug Reactions</h4>
<p>An adverse drug event (ADE) or reaction to a drug (ADR) is a harmful or unintended response. Adverse drug reactions are claimed to be the fourth leading cause of death, higher than pulmonary disease, AIDS, accidents, and automobile deaths. The FDA has further estimated that 300,000 preventable adverse events occur in hospitals, many as a result of confusing medical information or lack of information (eg, regarding drug incompatibilities). Adverse reactions occurring only in certain susceptible patients include intolerance, idiosyncrasy (frequently genetic in origin), and allergy (usually immunologically mediated). During IND studies and clinical trials before FDA approval, all adverse events (serious, life-threatening, disabling, reasonably drug related, or unexpected) must be reported. After FDA approval to market a drug, surveillance, evaluation, and reporting must continue for any adverse events that are related to use of the drug, including overdose, accident, failure of expected action, events occurring from drug withdrawal, and unexpected events not listed in labeling. Events that are both serious and unexpected must be reported to the FDA within 15 days. The ability to predict and avoid adverse drug reactions and optimize a drug’s therapeutic index is an increasing focus of pharmacogenetic and personalized (also called “precision”) medicine. It is hoped that greater use of electronic health records will reduce some of these risks (see Chapter 65).</p>
<h4 id="orphan-drugs--treatment-of-rare-diseases">Orphan Drugs &amp; Treatment of Rare Diseases</h4>
<p>Drugs for rare diseases—so-called orphan drugs—can be difficult to research, develop, and market. Proof of drug safety and efficacy in small populations must be established, but doing so is a complex process. Furthermore, because basic research in the pathophysiology and mechanisms of rare diseases receives relatively little attention or funding in both academic and industrial settings, recognized rational targets for drug action may be few. In addition, the cost of developing a drug can greatly influence priorities when the target population is relatively small. Funding for development of drugs for rare diseases or ignored diseases that do not receive priority attention from the traditional industry has received increasing support via philanthropy or similar funding from not-for-profit foundations such as the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Disease, the Huntington’s Disease Society of America, and the Gates Foundation.</p>
<p>The Orphan Drug Amendment of 1983 provides incentives for the development of drugs for treatment of a rare disease or condition defined as “any disease or condition which (a) affects less than 200,000 persons in the USA or (b) affects more than 200,000 persons in the USA but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the USA a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the USA of such drug.” Since 1983, the FDA has approved for marketing more than 300 orphan drugs to treat more than 82 rare diseases.</p>

## II DRUG DEVELOPMENT & REGULATION

A truly new drug (one that does not simply mimic the structure and action of previously available drugs) requires the discovery of a new drug target, ie, the pathophysiologic process or substrate of a disease. Such discoveries are usually made in public sector institutions (universities and research institutes), and molecules that have beneficial effects on such targets are often discovered in the same laboratories. However, the development of new drugs usually takes place in industrial laboratories because optimization of a class of new drugs requires painstaking and expensive chemical, pharmacologic, and toxicologic research. In fact, much of the recent progress in the application of drugs to disease problems can be ascribed to the pharmaceutical industry including “big pharma,” the multibilliondollar corporations that specialize in drug development and marketing. These companies are uniquely skilled in translating basic findings into successful therapeutic breakthroughs and profit-making “blockbusters”.

Such breakthroughs come at a price, however, and the escalating cost of drugs has become a significant contributor to the inflationary increase in the cost of health care. Development of new drugs is enormously expensive, but considerable controversy surrounds drug pricing. Critics claim that the costs of development and marketing are grossly inflated by marketing activities, advertising, and other promotional efforts, which may consume as much as 25% or more of a company’s budget. Furthermore, profit margins for big pharma are relatively high. Recent drug-pricing scandals have been reported in which the right to an older, established drug has been purchased by a smaller company and the price increased by several hundred or several thousand percent. This “price gouging” has caused public outrage and attracted regulatory attention that may result in more legitimate and rational pricing mechanisms. Finally, pricing schedules for many drugs vary dramatically from country to country and even within countries, where large organizations can negotiate favorable prices and small ones cannot. Some countries have already addressed these inequities, and it seems likely that all countries will have to do so during the next few decades.

### NEW DRUG DEVELOPMENT

The development of a new drug usually begins with the discovery or synthesis of a potential new drug compound or the elucidation of a new drug target. After a new drug molecule is synthesized or extracted from a natural source, subsequent steps seek an understanding of the drug’s interactions with its biologic targets. Repeated application of this approach leads to synthesis of related compounds with increased efficacy, potency, and selectivity (Figure 1–6). In the United States, the safety and efficacy of drugs must be established before marketing can be legally carried out. In addition to in vitro studies, relevant biologic effects, drug metabolism, pharmacokinetic profiles, and relative safety of the drug must be characterized in vivo in animals before human drug trials can be started. With regulatory approval, human testing may then go forward (usually in three phases) before the drug is considered for approval for general use. A fourth phase of data gathering and safety monitoring is becoming increasingly important and follows after approval for marketing. Once approved, the great majority of drugs become available for use by any appropriately licensed practitioner. Highly toxic drugs that are nevertheless considered valuable in lethal diseases may be approved for restricted use by practitioners who have undergone special training in their use and who maintain detailed records.

### DRUG DISCOVERY

Most new drugs or drug products are discovered or developed through the following approaches:

- screening for biologic activity of large numbers of natural products, banks of previously discovered chemical entities, or large libraries of peptides, nucleic acids, and other organic molecules;
- chemical modification of a known active molecule, resulting in a “me-too” analog;
- identification or elucidation of a new drug target; and
- rational design of a new molecule based on an understanding of biologic mechanisms and drug receptor structure.

Steps (3) and (4) are often carried out in academic research laboratories and are more likely to lead to breakthrough drugs, but the costs of steps (1) and (2) usually ensure that industry carries them out. Once a new drug target or promising molecule has been identified, the process of moving from the basic science laboratory to the clinic begins. This translational research involves the preclinical and clinical steps, described next. While clinical trials in humans are required only for drugs to be used in humans, all of the other steps described apply to veterinary drugs as well as drugs for human diseases.

#### Drug Screening

Drug screening involves a variety of assays at the molecular, cellular, organ system, and whole animal levels to define the pharmacologic profile, ie, the activity and selectivity of the drug. The type and number of initial screening tests depend on the pharmacologic and therapeutic goal. For example, anti-infective drugs are tested against a variety of infectious organisms, some of which are resistant to standard agents; hypoglycemic drugs are tested for their ability to lower blood sugar, etc. The molecule is also studied for a broad array of other actions to determine the mechanism of action and selectivity of the drug. This can reveal both expected and unexpected toxic effects. Occasionally, an unexpected therapeutic action is serendipitously discovered by a careful observer; for example, the era of modern diuretics was initiated by the observation that certain antimicrobial sulfonamides caused metabolic acidosis. The selection of compounds for development is most efficiently conducted in animal models of human disease. Where good predictive preclinical models exist (eg, infection, hypertension, or thrombotic disease), we generally have good or excellent drugs. Good drugs or breakthrough improvements are conspicuously lacking and slow for diseases for which preclinical models are poor or not yet available, eg, autism and Alzheimer’s disease. At the molecular level, the compound would be screened for activity on the target, for example, receptor binding affinity to cell membranes containing the homologous animal receptors (or if possible, on the cloned human receptors). Early studies would be done to predict effects that might later cause undesired drug metabolism or toxicologic complications. For example, studies on liver cytochrome P450 enzymes would be performed to determine whether the molecule of interest is likely to be a substrate or inhibitor of these enzymes or to alter the metabolism of other drugs. Effects on cell function determine whether the drug is an agonist, partial agonist, inverse agonist, or antagonist at relevant receptors. Isolated tissues would be used to characterize the pharmacologic activity and selectivity of the new compound in comparison with reference compounds. Comparison with other drugs would also be undertaken in a variety of in vivo studies. At each step in this process, the compound would have to meet specific performance and selectivity criteria to be carried further. Whole animal studies are generally necessary to determine the effect of the drug on organ systems and disease models. Cardiovascular and renal function studies of new drugs are generally first performed in normal animals. Studies on disease models, if available, are then performed. For a candidate antihypertensive drug, animals with hypertension would be treated to see whether blood pressure was lowered in a dose-related manner and to characterize other effects of the compound. Evidence would be collected on duration of action and efficacy after oral and parenteral administration. If the agent possessed useful activity, it would be further studied for possible adverse effects on other organs, including the respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, endocrine, and central nervous systems. These studies might suggest the need for further chemical modification (compound optimization) to achieve more desirable pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties. For example, oral administration studies might show that the drug was poorly absorbed or rapidly metabolized in the liver; modification to improve bioavailability might be indicated. If the drug was to be administered long term, an assessment of tolerance development would be made. For drugs related to or having mechanisms of action similar to those known to cause physical or psychological dependence in humans, ability to cause dependence in animals would also be studied. Drug interactions would be examined. The desired result of this screening procedure (which may have to be repeated several times with congeners of the original molecule) is a lead compound, ie, a leading candidate for a successful new drug. A patent application would be filed for a novel compound (a composition of matter patent) that is efficacious, or for a new and nonobvious therapeutic use (a use patent) for a previously known chemical entity.

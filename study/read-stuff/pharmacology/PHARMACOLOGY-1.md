## GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PHARMACOLOGY

![Basics](/images/phc-16.png)

### The history of Pharmacology

Prehistoric people undoubtedly recognized the beneficial or toxic effects of many plant and animal materials. Early written records list remedies of many types, including a few that are still recognized as useful drugs today. Most, however, were worthless or actually harmful. In the last 1500 years, sporadic attempts were made to introduce rational methods into medicine, but none was successful owing to the dominance of systems of thought (“schools”) that purported to explain all of biology and disease without the need for experimentation and observation. These schools promulgated bizarre notions such as the idea that disease was caused by excesses of bile or blood in the body, that wounds could be healed by applying a salve to the weapon that caused the wound, and so on.

Around the end of the 17th century, reliance on observation and experimentation began to replace theorizing in physiology and clinical medicine. As the value of these methods in the study of disease became clear, physicians in Great Britain and on the Continent began to apply them to the effects of traditional drugs used in their own practices. Thus, materia medica—the science of drug preparation and the medical uses of drugs—began to develop as the precursor to pharmacology. However, any real understanding of the mechanisms of action of drugs was prevented by the absence of methods for purifying active agents from the crude materials that were available and—even more—by the lack of methods for testing hypotheses about the nature of drug actions. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, François Magendie and his student Claude Bernard began to develop the methods of experimental physiology and pharmacology. Advances in chemistry and the further development of physiology in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries laid the foundation needed for understanding how drugs work at the organ and tissue levels. Paradoxically, real advances in basic pharmacology during this time were accompanied by an outburst of unscientific claims by manufacturers and marketers of worthless “patent medicines.” Not until the concepts of rational therapeutics, especially that of the controlled clinical trial, were reintroduced into medicine—only about 60 years ago—did it become possible to adequately evaluate therapeutic claims.

Around the 1940s and 1950s, a major expansion of research efforts in all areas of biology began. As new concepts and new techniques were introduced, information accumulated about drug action and the biologic substrate of that action, the drug receptor. During the last 60 years, many fundamentally new drug groups and new members of old groups were introduced. The last four decades have seen an even more rapid growth of information and understanding of the molecular basis for drug action. The molecular mechanisms of action of many drugs have now been identified, and numerous receptors have been isolated, structurally characterized, and cloned. In fact, the use of receptor identification methods (described in Chapter 2) has led to the discovery of many orphan receptors—receptors for which no ligand has been discovered and whose function can only be guessed. Studies of the local molecular environment of receptors have shown that receptors and effectors do not function in isolation; they are strongly influenced by other receptors and by companion regulatory proteins.

Pharmacogenomics—the relation of the individual’s genetic makeup to his or her response to specific drugs—is becoming an important part of therapeutics (see Chapter 5). Decoding of the genomes of many species—from bacteria to humans—has led to the recognition of unsuspected relationships between receptor families and the ways that receptor proteins have evolved. Discovery that small segments of RNA can interfere with protein synthesis with extreme selectivity has led to investigation of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and micro-RNAs (miRNAs) as therapeutic agents. Similarly, short nucleotide chains called antisense oligonucleotides (ANOs), synthesized to be complementary to natural RNA or DNA, can interfere with the readout of genes and the transcription of RNA. These intracellular targets may provide the next major wave of advances in therapeutics. Unfortunately, the medication-consuming public is still exposed to vast amounts of inaccurate or unscientific information regarding the pharmacologic effects of chemicals. This has resulted in the irrational use of innumerable expensive, ineffective, and sometimes harmful remedies and the growth of a huge “alternative health care” industry. Furthermore, manipulation of the legislative process in the United States has allowed many substances promoted for health—but not promoted specifically as “drugs”—to avoid meeting the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards described in the second part of this chapter. Conversely, lack of understanding of basic scientific principles in biology and statistics and the absence of critical thinking about public health issues have led to rejection of medical science by a segment of the public and to a common tendency to assume that all adverse drug effects are the result of malpractice.

General principles that the student should remember are (1) that all substances can under certain circumstances be toxic; (2) that the chemicals in botanicals (herbs and plant extracts, “nutraceuticals”) are no different from chemicals in manufactured drugs except for the much greater proportion of impurities in botanicals; and (3) that all dietary supplements and all therapies promoted as health-enhancing should meet the same standards of efficacy and safety as conventional drugs and medical therapies. That is, there should be no artificial separation between scientific medicine and “alternative” or “complementary” medicine. Ideally, all nutritional and botanical substances should be tested by the same types of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as synthetic compounds.

### THE NATURE OF DRUGS

In the most general sense, a drug may be defined as any substance that brings about a change in biologic function through its chemical actions. In most cases, the drug molecule interacts as an agonist (activator) or antagonist (inhibitor) with a specific target molecule that plays a regulatory role in the biologic system. This target molecule is called a receptor. The nature of receptors is discussed more fully in Chapter 2. In a very small number of cases, drugs known as chemical antagonists may interact directly with other drugs, whereas a few drugs (osmotic agents) interact almost exclusively with water molecules. Drugs may be synthesized within the body (eg, hormones) or may be chemicals not synthesized in the body (ie, xenobiotics). Poisons are drugs that have almost exclusively harmful effects. However, Paracelsus (1493–1541) famously stated that “the dose makes the poison,” meaning that any substance can be harmful if taken in the wrong dosage. Toxins are usually defined as poisons of biologic origin, ie, synthesized by plants or animals, in contrast to inorganic poisons such as lead and arsenic.

#### The Physical Nature of Drugs

To interact chemically with its receptor, a drug molecule must have the appropriate size, electrical charge, shape, and atomic composition. Furthermore, a drug is often administered at a location distant from its intended site of action, eg, a pill given orally to relieve a headache. Therefore, a useful drug must have the necessary properties to be transported from its site of administration to its site of action. Finally, a practical drug should be inactivated or excreted from the body at a reasonable rate so that its actions will be of appropriate duration. Drugs may be solid at room temperature (eg, aspirin, atropine), liquid (eg, nicotine, ethanol), or gaseous (eg, nitrous oxide). These factors often determine the best route of administration. The most common routes of administration are described in Chapter 3, Table 3–3. The various classes of organic compounds— carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and smaller molecules—are all represented in pharmacology. As noted above, oligonucleotides, in the form of small segments of RNA, have entered clinical trials and are on the threshold of introduction into therapeutics. A number of useful or dangerous drugs are inorganic elements, eg, lithium, iron, and heavy metals. Many organic drugs are weak acids or bases. This fact has important implications for the way they are handled by the body, because pH differences in the various compartments of the body may alter the degree of ionization of weak acids and bases (see text that follows).

#### Drug Size

The molecular size of drugs varies from very small (lithium ion, molecular weight [MW] 7) to very large (eg, alteplase [t-PA], a protein of MW 59,050). However, most drugs have molecular weights between 100 and 1000. The lower limit of this narrow range is probably set by the requirements for specificity of action. To have a good “fit” to only one type of receptor, a drug molecule must be sufficiently unique in shape, charge, and other properties to prevent its binding to other receptors. To achieve such selective binding, it appears that a molecule should in most cases be at least 100 MW units in size. The upper limit in molecular weight is determined primarily by the requirement that drugs must be able to move within the body (eg, from the site of administration to the site of action). Drugs much larger than MW 1000 do not diffuse readily between compartments of the body (see Permeation, in following text). Therefore, very large drugs (usually proteins) must often be administered directly into the compartment where they have their effect. In the case of alteplase, a clot-dissolving enzyme, the drug is administered directly into the vascular compartment by intravenous or intra-arterial infusion.

#### Drug Reactivity & Drug-Receptor Bonds

Drugs interact with receptors by means of chemical forces or bonds. These are of three major types: covalent, electrostatic, and hydrophobic. Covalent bonds are very strong and in many cases not reversible under biologic conditions. Thus, the covalent bond formed between the acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and cyclooxygenase, its enzyme target in platelets, is not readily broken. The platelet aggregation–blocking effect of aspirin lasts long after free acetylsalicylic acid has disappeared from the bloodstream (about 15 minutes) and is reversed only by the synthesis of new enzyme in new platelets, a process that takes several days.

Other examples of highly reactive, covalent bond-forming drugs include the DNA-alkylating agents used in cancer chemotherapy to disrupt cell division in the tumor. Electrostatic bonding is much more common than covalent bonding in drug-receptor interactions. Electrostatic bonds vary from relatively strong linkages between permanently charged ionic molecules to weaker hydrogen bonds and very weak induced dipole interactions such as van der Waals forces and similar phenomena. Electrostatic bonds are weaker than covalent bonds. Hydrophobic bonds are usually quite weak and are probably important in the interactions of highly lipid-soluble drugs with the lipids of cell membranes and perhaps in the interaction of drugs with the internal walls of receptor “pockets.” The specific nature of a particular drug-receptor bond is of less practical importance than the fact that drugs that bind through weak bonds to their receptors are generally more selective than drugs that bind by means of very strong bonds. This is because weak bonds require a very precise fit of the drug to its receptor if an interaction is to occur. Only a few receptor types are likely to provide such a precise fit for a particular drug structure. Thus, if we wished to design a highly selective short-acting drug for a particular receptor, we would avoid highly reactive molecules that form covalent bonds and instead choose a molecule that forms weaker bonds. A few substances that are almost completely inert in the chemical sense nevertheless have significant pharmacologic effects. For example, xenon, an “inert” gas, has anesthetic effects at elevated pressures.

#### Drug Shape

The shape of a drug molecule must be such as to permit binding to its receptor site via the bonds just described. Optimally, the drug’s shape is complementary to that of the receptor site in the same way that a key is complementary to a lock. Furthermore, the phenomenon of chirality (stereoisomerism) is so common in biology that more than half of all useful drugs are chiral molecules; that is, they can exist as enantiomeric pairs. Drugs with two asymmetric centers have four diastereomers, eg, ephedrine, a sympathomimetic drug. In most cases, one of these enantiomers is much more potent than its mirror image enantiomer, reflecting a better fit to the receptor molecule. If one imagines the receptor site to be like a glove into which the drug molecule must fit to bring about its effect, it is clear why a “left-oriented” drug is more effective in binding to a left-hand receptor than its “right-oriented” enantiomer. The more active enantiomer at one type of receptor site may not be more active at another receptor type, eg, a type that may be responsible for some other effect. For example, carvedilol, a drug that interacts with adrenoceptors, has a single chiral center and thus two enantiomers (Table 1–1). One of these enantiomers, the (S)(–) isomer, is a potent β-receptor blocker. The (R)(+) isomer is 100-fold weaker at the β receptor. However, the isomers are approximately equipotent as α-receptor blockers. Ketamine is an intravenous anesthetic. The (+) enantiomer is a more potent anesthetic and is less toxic than the (–) enantiomer. Unfortunately, the drug is still used as the racemic mixture.

Finally, because enzymes are usually stereoselective, one drug enantiomer is often more susceptible than the other to drug metabolizing enzymes. As a result, the duration of action of one enantiomer may be quite different from that of the other. Similarly, drug transporters may be stereoselective. Unfortunately, most studies of clinical efficacy and drug elimination in humans have been carried out with racemic mixtures of drugs rather than with the separate enantiomers. At present, only a small percentage of the chiral drugs used clinically are marketed as the active isomer—the rest are available only as racemic mixtures. As a result, most patients receive drug doses of which 50% is less active or inactive. Some drugs are currently available in both the racemic and the pure, active isomer forms. However, proof that administration of the pure, active enantiomer decreases adverse effects relative to those produced by racemic formulations has not been established.

#### Rational Drug Design

Rational design of drugs implies the ability to predict the appropriate molecular structure of a drug on the basis of information about its biologic receptor. Until recently, no receptor was known in sufficient detail to permit such drug design. Instead, drugs were developed through random testing of chemicals or modification of drugs already known to have some effect. However, the characterization of many receptors during the past three decades has changed this picture. A few drugs now in use were developed through molecular design based on knowledge of the three dimensional structure of the receptor site. Computer programs are now available that can iteratively optimize drug structures to fit known receptors. As more becomes known about receptor structure, rational drug design will become more common.

#### Receptor Nomenclature

The spectacular success of newer, more efficient ways to identify and characterize receptors (see Chapter 2) has resulted in a variety of differing, and sometimes confusing, systems for naming them. This in turn has led to a number of suggestions regarding more rational methods of naming receptors. The interested reader is referred for details to the efforts of the International Union of Pharmacology (IUPHAR) Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug Classification (reported in various issues of Pharmacological Reviews and elsewhere) and to Alexander SP et al: The Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2015/16: Overview.

### DRUG-BODY INTERACTIONS

The interactions between a drug and the body are conveniently divided into two classes. The actions of the drug on the body are termed pharmacodynamic processes (Figure 1–1); the principles of pharmacodynamics are presented in greater detail in Chapter 2. These properties determine the group in which the drug is classified, and they play the major role in deciding whether that group is appropriate therapy for a particular symptom or disease. The actions of the body on the drug are called pharmacokinetic processes and are described in Chapters 3 and 4. Pharmacokinetic processes govern the absorption, distribution, and elimination of drugs and are of great practical importance in the choice and administration of a particular drug for a particular patient, eg, a patient with impaired renal function. The following paragraphs provide a brief introduction to pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.

#### Pharmacodynamic Principles

Most drugs must bind to a receptor to bring about an effect. However, at the cellular level, drug binding is only the first in a sequence of steps:

Drug (D) + receptor-effector (R) → drug-receptor-effector complex → effect
D + R → drug-receptor complex → effector molecule → effect
D + R → D-R complex → activation of coupling molecule → effector molecule → effect
Inhibition of metabolism of endogenous activator → increased activator action on an effector molecule → increased effect

Note that the final change in function is accomplished by an effector mechanism. The effector may be part of the receptor molecule or may be a separate molecule. A very large number of receptors communicate with their effectors through coupling molecules, as described in Chapter 2.

A. Types of Drug-Receptor Interactions

Agonist drugs bind to and activate the receptor in some fashion, which directly or indirectly brings about the effect (Figure 1–2A). Receptor activation involves a change in conformation in the cases that have been studied at the molecular structure level. Some receptors incorporate effector machinery in the same molecule, so that drug binding brings about the effect directly, eg, opening of an ion channel or activation of enzyme activity. Other receptors are linked through one or more intervening coupling molecules to a separate effector molecule. The major types of drug-receptor-effector coupling systems are discussed in Chapter 2. Pharmacologic antagonist drugs, by binding to a receptor, compete with and prevent binding by other molecules. For example, acetylcholine receptor blockers such as atropine are antagonists because they prevent access of acetylcholine and similar agonist drugs to the acetylcholine receptor site and they stabilize the receptor in its inactive state (or some state other than the acetylcholine-activated state). These agents reduce the effects of acetylcholine and similar molecules in the body (Figure 1–2B), but their action can be overcome by increasing the dosage of agonist. Some antagonists bind very tightly to the receptor site in an irreversible or pseudo-irreversible fashion and cannot be displaced by increasing the agonist concentration. Drugs that bind to the same receptor molecule but do not prevent binding of the agonist are said to act allosterically and may enhance (Figure 1–2C) or inhibit (Figure 1–2D) the action of the agonist molecule. Allosteric inhibition is not usually overcome by increasing the dose of agonist.

B. Agonists That Inhibit Their Binding Molecules

Some drugs mimic agonist drugs by inhibiting the molecules responsible for terminating the action of an endogenous agonist. For example, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, by slowing the destruction of endogenous acetylcholine, cause cholinomimetic effects that closely resemble the actions of cholinoceptor agonist molecules even though cholinesterase inhibitors do not bind or only incidentally bind to cholinoceptors (see Chapter 7). Because they amplify the effects of physiologically released agonist ligands, their effects are sometimes more selective and less toxic than those of exogenous agonists.

C. Agonists, Partial Agonists, and Inverse Agonists

Figure 1–3 describes a useful model of drug-receptor interaction. As indicated, the receptor is postulated to exist in the inactive, nonfunctional form (Ri) and in the activated form (Ra). Thermodynamic considerations indicate that even in the absence of any agonist, some of the receptor pool must exist in the Ra form some of the time and may produce the same physiologic effect as agonist-induced activity. This effect, occurring in the absence of agonist, is termed constitutive activity. Agonists have a much higher affinity for the Ra configuration and stabilize it, so that a large percentage of the total pool resides in the Ra–D fraction and a large effect is produced. The recognition of constitutive activity may depend on the receptor density, the concentration of coupling molecules (if a coupled system), and the number of effectors in the system. Many agonist drugs, when administered at concentrations sufficient to saturate the receptor pool, can activate their receptoreffector systems to the maximum extent of which the system is capable; that is, they cause a shift of almost all of the receptor pool to the Ra–D pool. Such drugs are termed full agonists. Other drugs, called partial agonists, bind to the same receptors and activate them in the same way but do not evoke as great a response, no matter how high the concentration. In the model in Figure 1–3, partial agonists do not stabilize the Ra configuration as fully as full agonists, so that a significant fraction of receptors exists in the Ri–D pool. Such drugs are said to have low intrinsic efficacy. Because they occupy the receptor, partial agonists can also prevent access by full agonists. Thus, pindolol, a β-adrenoceptor partial agonist, may act either as an agonist (if no full agonist is present) or as an antagonist (if a full agonist such as epinephrine is present). (See Chapter 2.) Intrinsic efficacy is independent of affinity (as usually measured) for the receptor.

In the same model, conventional antagonist action can be explained as fixing the fractions of drug-bound Ri and Ra in the same relative amounts as in the absence of any drug. In this situation, no change in activity will be observed, so the drug will appear to be without effect. However, the presence of the antagonist at the receptor site will block access of agonists to the receptor and prevent the usual agonist effect. Such blocking action can be termed neutral antagonism. What will happen if a drug has a much stronger affinity for the Ri than for the Ra state and stabilizes a large fraction in the Ri–D pool? In this scenario the drug will reduce any constitutive activity, thus resulting in effects that are the opposite of the effects produced by conventional agonists at that receptor. Such drugs are termed inverse agonists (Figure 1–3). One of the best documented examples of such a system is the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptoreffector (a chloride channel) in the nervous system. This receptor is activated by the endogenous transmitter GABA and causes inhibition of postsynaptic cells. Conventional exogenous agonists such as benzodiazepines also facilitate the receptor-effector system and cause GABA-like inhibition with sedation as the therapeutic result. This sedation can be reversed by conventional neutral antagonists such as flumazenil. Inverse agonists of this receptor system cause anxiety and agitation, the inverse of sedation (see Chapter 22). Similar inverse agonists have been found for β adrenoceptors, histamine H1 and H2 receptors, and several other receptor systems.

D. Duration of Drug Action

Termination of drug action can result from several processes. In some cases, the effect lasts only as long as the drug occupies the receptor, and dissociation of drug from the receptor automatically terminates the effect. In many cases, however, the action may persist after the drug has dissociated because, for example, some coupling molecule is still present in activated form. In the case of drugs that bind covalently to the receptor site, the effect may persist until the drug-receptor complex is destroyed and new receptors or enzymes are synthesized, as described previously for aspirin.

In addition, many receptor-effector systems incorporate desensitization mechanisms for preventing excessive activation when agonist molecules continue to be present for long periods. (See Chapter 2 for additional details.)

E. Receptors and Inert Binding Sites

To function as a receptor, an endogenous molecule must first be selective in choosing ligands (drug molecules) to bind; and second, it must change its function upon binding in such a way that the function of the biologic system (cell, tissue, etc) is altered. The selectivity characteristic is required to avoid constant activation of the receptor by promiscuous binding of many different ligands. The ability to change function is clearly necessary if the ligand is to cause a pharmacologic effect. The body contains a vast array of molecules that are capable of binding drugs, however, and not all of these endogenous molecules are regulatory molecules. Binding of a drug to a non-regulatory molecule such as plasma albumin will result in no detectable change in the function of the biologic system, so this endogenous molecule can be called an inert binding site. Such binding is not completely without significance, however, because it affects the distribution of drug within the body and determines the amount of free drug in the circulation. Both of these factors are of pharmacokinetic importance (see also Chapter 3).

### Pharmacokinetic Principles

In practical therapeutics, a drug should be able to reach its intended site of action after administration by some convenient route. In many cases, the active drug molecule is sufficiently lipid-soluble and stable to be given as such. In some cases, however, an inactive precursor chemical that is readily absorbed and distributed must be administered and then converted to the active drug by biologic processes— inside the body. Such a precursor chemical is called a prodrug. In only a few situations is it possible to apply a drug directly to its target tissue, eg, by topical application of an anti-inflammatory agent to inflamed skin or mucous membrane. Most often, a drug is administered into one body compartment, eg, the gut, and must move to its site of action in another compartment, eg, the brain in the case of an anti-seizure medication. This requires that the drug be absorbed into the blood from its site of administration and distributed to its site of action, permeating through the various barriers that separate these compartments. For a drug given orally to produce an effect in the central nervous system, these barriers include the tissues that make up the wall of the intestine, the walls of the capillaries that perfuse the gut, and the blood-brain barrier, the walls of the capillaries that perfuse the brain. Finally, after bringing about its effect, a drug should be eliminated at a reasonable rate by metabolic inactivation, by excretion from the body, or by a combination of these processes.

#### Permeation

Drug permeation proceeds by several mechanisms. Passive diffusion in an aqueous or lipid medium is common, but active processes play a role in the movement of many drugs, especially those whose molecules are too large to diffuse readily (Figure 1–4). Drug vehicles can be very important in facilitating transport and permeation, eg, by encapsulating the active agent in liposomes and in regulating release, as in slow release preparations. Newer methods of facilitating transport of drugs by coupling them to nanoparticles are under investigation.

![image](/images/phc-22.png)

1. Aqueous diffusion—Aqueous diffusion occurs within the larger aqueous compartments of the body (interstitial space, cytosol, etc) and across epithelial membrane tight junctions and the endothelial lining of blood vessels through aqueous pores that—in some tissues—permit the passage of molecules as large as MW 20,000–30,000.\* See Figure 1–4A.
2. Lipid diffusion—Lipid diffusion is the most important limiting factor for drug permeation because of the large number of lipid barriers that separate the compartments of the body. Because these lipid barriers separate aqueous compartments, the lipid aqueous partition coefficient of a drug determines how readily the molecule moves between aqueous and lipid media. In the case of weak acids and weak bases (which gain or lose electrical charge-bearing protons, depending on the pH), the ability to move from aqueous to lipid or vice versa varies with the pH of the medium, because charged molecules attract water molecules. The ratio of lipid-soluble form to water-soluble form for a weak acid or weak base is expressed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (described in the following text). See Figure 1–4B.
3. Special carriers—Special carrier molecules exist for many substances that are important for cell function and too large or too insoluble in lipid to diffuse passively through membranes, eg, peptides, amino acids, and glucose. These carriers bring about movement by active transport or facilitated diffusion and, unlike passive diffusion, are selective, saturable, and inhibitable. Because many drugs are or resemble such naturally occurring peptides, amino acids, or sugars, they can use these carriers to cross membranes. See Figure 1–4C. Many cells also contain less selective membrane carriers that are specialized for expelling foreign molecules. One large family of such transporters binds adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and is called the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) family. This family includes the P-glycoprotein or multidrug resistance type 1 (MDR1) transporter found in the brain, testes, and other tissues, and in some drug-resistant neoplastic cells (Table 1–2). Similar transport molecules from the ABC family, the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) transporters, play important roles in the excretion of some drugs or their metabolites into urine and bile and in the resistance of some tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs. Several other transporter families have been identified that do not bind ATP but use ion gradients to drive transport. Some of these (the solute carrier [SLC] family) are particularly important in the uptake of neurotransmitters across nerve-ending membranes. The latter carriers are discussed in more detail in Chapter 6.
4. Endocytosis and exocytosis—A few substances are so large or impermeant that they can enter cells only by endocytosis, the process by which the substance is bound at a cell-surface receptor, engulfed by the cell membrane, and carried into the cell by pinching off of the newly formed vesicle inside the membrane. The substance can then be released into the cytosol by breakdown of the vesicle membrane, Figure 1–4D. This process is responsible for the transport of vitamin B12, complexed with a binding protein (intrinsic factor) across the wall of the gut into the blood. Similarly, iron is transported into hemoglobin-synthesizing red blood cell precursors in association with the protein transferrin. Specific receptors for the binding proteins must be present for this process to work. The reverse process (exocytosis) is responsible for the secretion of many substances from cells. For example, many neurotransmitter substances are stored in membrane-bound vesicles in nerve endings to protect them from metabolic destruction in the cytoplasm. Appropriate activation of the nerve ending causes fusion of the storage vesicle with the cell membrane and expulsion of its contents into the extracellular space (see Chapter 6).

### Fick's Law of Diffusion

The passive flux of molecules down a concentration gradient is given by Fick’s law:

![image](/images/p23.png)

where C1 is the higher concentration, C2 is the lower concentration, area is the cross-sectional area of the diffusion path, permeability coefficient is a measure of the mobility of the drug molecules in the medium of the diffusion path, and thickness is the length of the diffusion path. In the case of lipid diffusion, the lipid:aqueous partition coefficient is a major determinant of mobility of the drug because it determines how readily the drug enters the lipid membrane from the aqueous medium.

#### Ionization of Weak Acids and Weak Bases; the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation

The electrostatic charge of an ionized molecule attracts water dipoles and results in a polar, relatively water-soluble and lipid-insoluble complex. Because lipid diffusion depends on relatively high lipid solubility, ionization of drugs may markedly reduce their ability to permeate membranes. A very large percentage of the drugs in use are weak acids or weak bases; Table 1–3 lists some examples. For drugs, a weak acid is best defined as a neutral molecule that can reversibly dissociate into an anion (a negatively charged molecule) and a proton (a hydrogen ion). For example, aspirin dissociates as follows: A weak base can be defined as a neutral molecule that can form a cation (a positively charged molecule) by combining with a proton.

For example, pyrimethamine, an antimalarial drug, undergoes the following association-dissociation process:
Note that the protonated form of a weak acid is the neutral, more lipid-soluble form, whereas the unprotonated form of a weak base is the neutral form. The law of mass action requires that these reactions move to the left in an acid environment (low pH, excess protons available) and to the right in an alkaline environment. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates the ratio of protonated to unprotonated weak acid or weak base to the molecule’s pKa and the pH of the medium as follows: This equation applies to both acidic and basic drugs. Inspection confirms that the lower the pH relative to the pKa, the greater will be the fraction of drug in the protonated form. Because the uncharged form is the more lipid-soluble, more of a weak acid will be in the lipid-soluble form at acid pH, whereas more of a basic drug will be in the lipid-soluble form at alkaline pH. Application of this principle is made in the manipulation of drug excretion by the kidney (see Case Study). Almost all drugs are filtered at the glomerulus. If a drug is in a lipid-soluble form during its passage down the renal tubule, a significant fraction will be reabsorbed by simple passive diffusion. If the goal is to accelerate excretion of the drug (eg, in a case of drug overdose), it is important to prevent its reabsorption from the tubule. This can often be accomplished by adjusting urine pH to make certain that most of the drug is in the ionized state, as shown in Figure 1–5. As a result of this partitioning effect, the drug is “trapped” in the urine. Thus, weak acids are usually excreted faster in alkaline urine; weak bases are usually excreted faster in acidic urine. Other body fluids in which pH differences from blood pH may cause trapping or reabsorption are the contents of the stomach (normal pH 1.9–3) and small intestine (pH 7.5–8), breast milk (pH 6.4–7.6), aqueous humor (pH 6.4–7.5), and vaginal and prostatic secretions (pH 3.5–7).

As indicated by Table 1–3, a large number of drugs are weak bases. Most of these bases are amine-containing molecules. The nitrogen of a neutral amine has three atoms associated with it plus a pair of unshared electrons (see the display that follows). The three atoms may consist of one carbon or a chain of carbon atoms (designated “R”) and two hydrogens (a primary amine), two carbons and one hydrogen (a secondary amine), or three carbon atoms (a tertiary amine). Each of these three forms may reversibly bind a proton with the unshared electrons. Some drugs have a fourth carbon-nitrogen bond; these are quaternary amines. However, the quaternary amine is permanently charged and has no unshared electrons with which to reversibly bind a proton. Therefore, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines may undergo reversible protonation and vary their lipid solubility with pH, but quaternary amines are always in the poorly lipid-soluble charged form.

### DRUG GROUPS

To learn each pertinent fact about each of the many hundreds of drugs mentioned in this book would be an impractical goal and, fortunately, is unnecessary. Almost all the several thousand drugs currently available can be arranged into about 70 groups. Many of the drugs within each group are very similar in pharmacodynamic actions and in their pharmacokinetic properties as well. For most groups, one or two prototype drugs can be identified that typify the most important characteristics of the group. This permits classification of other important drugs in the group as variants of the prototype, so that only the prototype must be learned in detail and, for the remaining drugs, only the differences from the prototype.

## II DRUG DEVELOPMENT & REGULATION

A truly new drug (one that does not simply mimic the structure and action of previously available drugs) requires the discovery of a new drug target, ie, the pathophysiologic process or substrate of a disease. Such discoveries are usually made in public sector institutions (universities and research institutes), and molecules that have beneficial effects on such targets are often discovered in the same laboratories. However, the development of new drugs usually takes place in industrial laboratories because optimization of a class of new drugs requires painstaking and expensive chemical, pharmacologic, and toxicologic research. In fact, much of the recent progress in the application of drugs to disease problems can be ascribed to the pharmaceutical industry including “big pharma,” the multibilliondollar corporations that specialize in drug development and marketing. These companies are uniquely skilled in translating basic findings into successful therapeutic breakthroughs and profit-making “blockbusters” (see http://www.pharmacytimes. com/news/10-best-selling-brand-name-drugs-in-2015/). Such breakthroughs come at a price, however, and the escalating cost of drugs has become a significant contributor to the inflationary increase in the cost of health care. Development of new drugs is enormously expensive, but considerable controversy surrounds drug pricing. Critics claim that the costs of development and marketing are grossly inflated by marketing activities, advertising, and other promotional efforts, which may consume as much as 25% or more of a company’s budget. Furthermore, profit margins for big pharma are relatively high. Recent drug-pricing scandals have been reported in which the right to an older, established drug has been purchased by a smaller company and the price increased by several hundred or several thousand percent. This “price gouging” has caused public outrage and attracted regulatory attention that may result in more legitimate and rational pricing mechanisms. Finally, pricing schedules for many drugs vary dramatically from country to country and even within countries, where large organizations can negotiate favorable prices and small ones cannot. Some countries have already addressed these inequities, and it seems likely that all countries will have to do so during the next few decades.

### NEW DRUG DEVELOPMENT

The development of a new drug usually begins with the discovery or synthesis of a potential new drug compound or the elucidation of a new drug target. After a new drug molecule is synthesized or extracted from a natural source, subsequent steps seek an understanding of the drug’s interactions with its biologic targets. Repeated application of this approach leads to synthesis of related compounds with increased efficacy, potency, and selectivity (Figure 1–6). In the United States, the safety and efficacy of drugs must be established before marketing can be legally carried out. In addition to in vitro studies, relevant biologic effects, drug metabolism, pharmacokinetic profiles, and relative safety of the drug must be characterized in vivo in animals before human drug trials can be started. With regulatory approval, human testing may then go forward (usually in three phases) before the drug is considered for approval for general use. A fourth phase of data gathering and safety monitoring is becoming increasingly important and follows after approval for marketing. Once approved, the great majority of drugs become available for use by any appropriately licensed practitioner. Highly toxic drugs that are nevertheless considered valuable in lethal diseases may be approved for restricted use by practitioners who have undergone special training in their use and who maintain detailed records.

### DRUG DISCOVERY

Most new drugs or drug products are discovered or developed through the following approaches: (1) screening for biologic activity of large numbers of natural products, banks of previously discovered chemical entities, or large libraries of peptides, nucleic acids, and other organic molecules; (2) chemical modification of a known active molecule, resulting in a “me-too” analog; (3) identification or elucidation of a new drug target; and (4) rational design of a new molecule based on an understanding of biologic mechanisms and drug receptor structure. Steps (3) and (4) are often carried out in academic research laboratories and are more likely to lead to breakthrough drugs, but the costs of steps (1) and (2) usually ensure that industry carries them out. Once a new drug target or promising molecule has been identified, the process of moving from the basic science laboratory to the clinic begins. This translational research involves the preclinical and clinical steps, described next. While clinical trials in humans are required only for drugs to be used in humans, all of the other steps described apply to veterinary drugs as well as drugs for human diseases.

#### Drug Screening

Drug screening involves a variety of assays at the molecular, cellular, organ system, and whole animal levels to define the pharmacologic profile, ie, the activity and selectivity of the drug. The type and number of initial screening tests depend on the pharmacologic and therapeutic goal. For example, anti-infective drugs are tested against a variety of infectious organisms, some of which are resistant to standard agents; hypoglycemic drugs are tested for their ability to lower blood sugar, etc. The molecule is also studied for a broad array of other actions to determine the mechanism of action and selectivity of the drug. This can reveal both expected and unexpected toxic effects. Occasionally, an unexpected therapeutic action is serendipitously discovered by a careful observer; for example, the era of modern diuretics was initiated by the observation that certain antimicrobial sulfonamides caused metabolic acidosis. The selection of compounds for development is most efficiently conducted in animal models of human disease. Where good predictive preclinical models exist (eg, infection, hypertension, or thrombotic disease), we generally have good or excellent drugs. Good drugs or breakthrough improvements are conspicuously lacking and slow for diseases for which preclinical models are poor or not yet available, eg, autism and Alzheimer’s disease. At the molecular level, the compound would be screened for activity on the target, for example, receptor binding affinity to cell membranes containing the homologous animal receptors (or if possible, on the cloned human receptors). Early studies would be done to predict effects that might later cause undesired drug metabolism or toxicologic complications. For example, studies on liver cytochrome P450 enzymes would be performed to determine whether the molecule of interest is likely to be a substrate or inhibitor of these enzymes or to alter the metabolism of other drugs. Effects on cell function determine whether the drug is an agonist, partial agonist, inverse agonist, or antagonist at relevant receptors. Isolated tissues would be used to characterize the pharmacologic activity and selectivity of the new compound in comparison with reference compounds. Comparison with other drugs would also be undertaken in a variety of in vivo studies. At each step in this process, the compound would have to meet specific performance and selectivity criteria to be carried further. Whole animal studies are generally necessary to determine the effect of the drug on organ systems and disease models. Cardiovascular and renal function studies of new drugs are generally first performed in normal animals. Studies on disease models, if available, are then performed. For a candidate antihypertensive drug, animals with hypertension would be treated to see whether blood pressure was lowered in a dose-related manner and to characterize other effects of the compound. Evidence would be collected on duration of action and efficacy after oral and parenteral administration. If the agent possessed useful activity, it would be further studied for possible adverse effects on other organs, including the respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, endocrine, and central nervous systems. These studies might suggest the need for further chemical modification (compound optimization) to achieve more desirable pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties. For example, oral administration studies might show that the drug was poorly absorbed or rapidly metabolized in the liver; modification to improve bioavailability might be indicated. If the drug was to be administered long term, an assessment of tolerance development would be made. For drugs related to or having mechanisms of action similar to those known to cause physical or psychological dependence in humans, ability to cause dependence in animals would also be studied. Drug interactions would be examined. The desired result of this screening procedure (which may have to be repeated several times with congeners of the original molecule) is a lead compound, ie, a leading candidate for a successful new drug. A patent application would be filed for a novel compound (a composition of matter patent) that is efficacious, or for a new and nonobvious therapeutic use (a use patent) for a previously known chemical entity.

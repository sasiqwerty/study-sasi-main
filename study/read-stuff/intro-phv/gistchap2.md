# Harm and Safety

## Introduction

The two most important concepts in pharmacovigilance are opposites. Harm and safety. ADR is the usual term for harm, and pharmacovigilance fundamentally is about preventing and managing these ADRs.

Every medicine has its advantages and disadvantages. If the side effects of the medicine threaten or affect the life of the patient in a significant way, we say it outweighs its benefits, and call it harmful. In that sense we can define the 'side effect' as the unintended affect of the medicine, and in most cases its undesirable but in some cases it might help the patient in a previously unexpected way.

An 'adverse drug reaction' on the other hand is an unintended and noxious effect that is attributable to the medicine and it happens to manifest in the range of doses used in humans for prophylaxis. In the case of an 'adverse event', its defined as an undesirable occurrence in the context of drug treatment but which may or may not be causally related to the drug of interest.

## Classification Systems

Most of the drugs humans consume for prophylaxis might cause problems. Overdosing of the medicine, reactions with concomitant medications and so on.

It is easier to classify the ADRs based on their contrasting characteristics.

### The Traditional Classification

#### Type A

Type A are also called Augmented reactions are generally dose related and predictable from drug pharmacology. They are also common, reversible and are manageable with dose adjustment.

#### Type B

Type B are also called bizarre reactions are generally not dose related,unpredictable and uncommon. They are in most cases irreversible and indicative that the drug taken must be stopped immediately.

#### Type C,D and E

If the drug in question causes the problem to persist for a long time or is constantly recurring, its termed as the type 'chronic' and as the type 'delayed' if the adverse effect manifests over a period of time or after a certain period of time. If the events are linked to the end of use ( like withdrawal) of the particular drug they are termed as type 'end of use'.

### DoTS Classification

The DoTs classification is based on Dose relatedness, time course and susceptibility. Most ADRs clearly do not fit into the A/B scheme, this approach helps to solve that problem.

In terms of dose-relatedness toxic means that the dose was too high and collateral means that the effect occurred in the usual therapeutic ranges while hyper-susceptibility means that reactions can occur even at very low, sub-therapeutic doses.

The terms early, intermediate and late are not precisely defined but the main difference between late and delayed is that the latter can occur long after the treatment is stopped.

## Nature and Mechanism of ADRs

The adverse effects of medicines usually mimic diseases or syndromes that occur naturally and have a variety of non-drug potential causes.

In broad terms ADRs can be categorised into 4 types.

- exaggerated therapeutic response at the target site
- desired pharmacological effect at another site
- additional/secondary pharmacological actions
- Triggering an immune response

## Predisposing Factors for ADRs

- Age, older people are at a higher risk
- Gender, Women are generally at a higher risk
- Ethnic Origin, Can effect drug metabolism because of genetic predisposition
- Impaired excretory mechanisms
- Specific diseases
- Polypharmacy
- Any previous history of an ADR

    <h1>What is Pharmacovigilance and How Has it Developed?</h1>

    <h2>Origins and Definition of Pharmacovigilance</h2>

    <p>
      In the beginning, there was thalidomide. The history of drug safety goes
      back further but, for practical purposes, the story of modern
      pharmacovigilance begins there. In the late 1950s there was little, if
      any, regulation of medicines outside the USA (where thalidomide was not
      allowed on to the market), and their testing and development was almost
      entirely in the hands of pharmaceutical companies. In the case of
      thalidomide, unjustified claims of safety in pregnancy were made, and its
      use as a sedative and treatment for nausea and vomiting was targeted at
      pregnant women. The drug turned out to be a teratogen, producing a variety
      of birth defects but particularly limb defects known as phocomelia (Figure
      1.1).
    </p>

    <p>
      Worldwide, about 10 000 babies were affected, particularly in Germany
      where the drug was first marketed. As phocomelia was otherwise a very rare
      congenital abnormality, a major increase in its incidence did not go
      unnoticed in Germany, but the cause was initially thought to be
      environmental. In 1961, a series of just three cases of congenital
      anomalies associated with thalidomide use in Australia was reported in The
      Lancet, the problem was finally recognised and the drug withdrawn from
      sale.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the beginning of the 1960s, publication of possible adverse effects of
      drugs in the medical literature was effectively the only mechanism for
      drawing attention to them. Thalidomide produced a non‐lethal but visible
      and shocking adverse effect, leading people to ask why so many damaged
      babies had been born before anything had been done? This question is
      central to subsequent developments. It is unlikely that we will ever be
      able to predict and prevent all the harms that may be caused by medicines,
      but limiting the damage to much smaller numbers is now achievable. Today
      we would expect to be able to identify an association between drug and
      outcome analogous to thalidomide and phocomelia after the occurrence of
      less than 10 cases, so at least three orders of magnitude more effectively
      than six decades ago.
    </p>

    <p>
      The overriding lesson learnt from thalidomide was that we cannot just wait
      until a drug safety problem hits us. The thalidomide tragedy of the 1960s
      led directly to the initial development of the systems we have in place
      today, although it is only since the early 1990s that the term
      pharmacovigilance has become widely accepted. Pharmacovigilance is defined
      by the World Health Organization as ‘The science and activities relating
      to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse
      effects or any other drug-related problems.’ There are other definitions
      but this very broad one seems to be the most appropriate because there is
      a clear implication that the process is one of risk management. This is a
      concept that is applicable to many aspects of modern life but,
      surprisingly, its explicit use in relation to pharmaceuticals is a fairly
      recent development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thalidomide is not merely of historical interest, as in recent years it
      has made a comeback on to the market in some countries but with very
      narrow indications and extensive safeguards. The reasons for this
      exemplify the point about risk management, as the risk of fetal
      malformation can be successfully managed by avoidance of the drug during
      pregnancy. It also demonstrates another concept that is central to the
      practice of pharmacovigilance – the balance of benefit and risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thalidomide has benefits in some diseases that are otherwise difficult to
      treat (e.g. refractory multiple myeloma) and these appear to outweigh the
      risk of fetal malformation if there is an effective pregnancy prevention
      scheme in place. A further point that thalidomide illustrates well – and
      which is relevant to many other drug safety issues – is that not everyone
      is at the same risk of a particular adverse effect. In this case, a
      substantial part of the population (including men and also women who are
      not of childbearing capacity) are not at risk of phocomelia.
    </p>

    <h3>Main Lessons Learned from Thalidomide</h3>

    <p>The thalidomide tragedy taught us many lessons:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The need for adequate testing of medicines prior to marketing.</li>
      <li>The need for government regulation of medicines.</li>
      <li>
        The need for reporting systems to identify the adverse effects of
        medicines.
      </li>
      <li>The potential safety implications of unproven marketing claims.</li>
      <li>
        Most medicines cross the placenta and this results in fetal exposure.
      </li>
      <li>Avoidance of unnecessary use of medicines in pregnancy.</li>
      <li>That some risks can be successfully minimised.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The ramifications of the thalidomide tragedy were manyfold, but the key
      lesson for the development of pharmacovigilance was that active systems
      for detecting hazards are needed. Within a few years this had been taken
      forward with the introduction of voluntary (or ‘spontaneous’) schemes for
      reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). These have stood the
      test of time as an alerting mechanism or early warning system, and are
      covered in more detail in Chapter 3.
    </p>

    <h2>Scope and Purposes of Pharmacovigilance</h2>

    <p>
      In the past, the process of pharmacovigilance has often been considered to
      start when a drug is first authorised for use in ordinary practice.
      Nowadays, it is more commonly considered to include all safety‐related
      activity beyond the point at which humans are first exposed to a new
      medicinal product.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ultimate purpose of pharmacovigilance is to minimise, in practice, the
      potential for harm that is associated with all active medicines. Although
      data about all types of ADRs are collected, a key focus is on identifying
      and preventing those that are defined to be serious. This is generally
      defined as an ADR that meets at least one of the following criteria:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fatal</li>
      <li>Life‐threatening</li>
      <li>Causes or prolongs hospitalisation</li>
      <li>Results in long‐term disability</li>
      <li>All congenital anomalies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The definition of serious also allows the application of medical
      judgement, such that a reaction can be considered serious even if there is
      not clear evidence that one of the above criteria is met. Non-serious
      reactions are important to individual patients and health professionals
      involved in their treatment, but they can usually be managed clinically
      and impact less on the balance of benefit and risk for individual products
      and on public health in general.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, pharmacovigilance can be seen as a public health function in which
      reductions in the occurrence of serious harms are achievable through
      measures that promote the safest possible use of medicinal products and/or
      provide specific safeguards against known hazards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pregnancy prevention in users of thalidomide is an example of such a
      safeguard; monitoring white blood cell counts to detect agranulocytosis
      (absent white blood cells) in users of the antipsychotic drug clozapine is
      another (see Chapter 7). In order to minimise harms, there is first a need
      to identify and assess the impact of unexpected potential hazards. For
      most medicines, serious ADRs are rare, otherwise their detection would
      result in the drug not reaching (or being withdrawn from) the market. For
      products that do reach the market, serious hazards are seldom identified
      during pre‐marketing clinical trials because sample sizes are invariably
      too small to detect them. In addition, the prevailing conditions of
      clinical trials – selected patients, short durations of treatment, close
      monitoring and specialist supervision – usually mean that the frequency of
      ADRs will be underestimated relative to what will really occur in ordinary
      practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      During pre‐marketing clinical development and research on new medicines,
      the aims of pharmacovigilance are rather different from the broad public
      health functions described here. In volunteer studies and clinical trials,
      there is a need to protect individuals exposed to experimental products
      (from which they may derive no benefit) from potential harm. There is also
      a need to gather information on risks (including the frequencies at which
      they happen) in order to make a provisional assessment of safety and to
      plan for post-marketing safety development (see Risk Management Planning
      in Chapter 5).
    </p>

    <h2>Development of Pharmacovigilance</h2>

    <p>
      We next consider some of the most important examples of drug safety issues
      and discuss how they have affected the development of pharmacovigilance
      practice from the 1960s to the present day.
    </p>

    <h3>Practolol</h3>

    <p>
      In the early 1970s another drug safety disaster occurred; this was the
      oculo‐mucocutaneous syndrome, a multi‐system disorder, caused by practolol
      (Eraldin), a cardioselective beta‐blocker used to treat angina and
      hypertension. As in the case of thalidomide, several thousand individuals
      were permanently damaged before the association was recognised. The
      fundamental problem in this instance was a failure of timely
      identification, as despite having an early warning system in place, the
      system was dependent on doctors suspecting an association between drug and
      disease. Probably because of the unusual nature of the syndrome – dry
      eyes, skin rash and bowel obstruction – and a long latency period
      (averaging almost 2 years in respect of the onset of the most serious
      bowel manifestations), relevant cases were not reported until the
      association was identified in the medical literature. Around 3000 cases
      were then retrospectively reported to the UK Yellow Card spontaneous ADR
      reporting scheme (see Chapter 3),an example of the potential effect of
      publicity on ADR reporting.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interestingly, subsequent attempts to develop an animal model of practolol
      toxicity failed, indicating that the problem could not have been predicted
      from pre‐clinical studies.
    </p>

    <h4>Main Lessons Learned from Practolol</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Some adverse effects are not predictable from pre‐clinical studies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spontaneous reporting schemes are not always effective at identifying
        new ADRs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Health professionals may not be able to identify long latency effects
        and clinical manifestations not known to be related to other drugs as
        ADRs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional, proactive and more systematic methods of studying
        post‐marketing safety are needed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The overriding message from practolol was that spontaneous ADR reporting
      alone is insufficient as a means of studying post‐marketing safety. Thus,
      in the late 1970s various schemes designed to closely monitor the
      introduction of new drugs were suggested, but few implemented. The basic
      idea was that initial users of new drugs would be identified through
      prescriptions and monitored systematically rather than waiting for someone
      to recognise a possible adverse effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      The concept did come to fruition in New Zealand and in England in the late
      1970s with the development of nationwide prescription‐event monitoring
      (PEM) programmes (see Chapter 3).
    </p>

    <h3>Benoxaprofen</h3>

    <p>
      The first drug studied by PEM in England was benoxaprofen (Opren), a
      non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) which frequently produced
      photosensitivity reactions (i.e. rashes in light‐exposed areas). A
      published case series from Northern Ireland of five deaths related to
      hepatic and renal failure led to withdrawal of the drug in 1982, although
      the PEM study did not reveal any indication of these effects. Many of the
      patients who experienced serious ADRs with benoxaprofen were elderly; this
      was a result of reduced excretion of the drug as a consequence of renal
      impairment. Even though it is well‐recognised that many patients who use
      NSAIDs are elderly (e.g. for arthritis or chronic pain), benoxaprofen had
      not been adequately studied in this population prior to marketing. A
      reduction in the dosage recommendations for the elderly was implemented
      briefly, but benoxaprofen was withdrawn soon afterwards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the usage of benoxaprofen took off rapidly after launch and an
      important adverse effect – photosensitivity reactions – was common, a
      large number of spontaneous reports were received in a short period of
      time, swamping the primitive computer systems then used and pointing to
      the need for purpose‐designed databases. The issue also illustrated the
      need for patients to be properly informed about possible ADRs and how to
      minimise the risk – in this case by avoiding exposure to the sun. It was
      therefore influential in moving towards the introduction of patient
      information leaflets, which became compulsory in the European Union (EU)
      during the 1990s.
    </p>

    <h4>Main Lessons Learned from Benoxaprofen</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Uncertainty about cause and effect from individual case reports –
        further impetus to the need for formal post‐marketing studies in patient
        cohorts of sufficient size.
      </li>
      <li>
        The need to study a drug in populations most likely to use it (e.g. the
        elderly).
      </li>
      <li>
        The need for purpose‐designed computer systems to handle ADR reports
        more promptly and effectively.
      </li>
      <li>
        The concept of intensive surveillance of new drugs, later achieved in
        the UK by the introduction of the Black Triangle scheme (see Glossary).
      </li>
      <li>The need for patients to be informed about possible ADRs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Benoxaprofen was just the first of a series of NSAIDs withdrawn for
      various safety reasons in the 1980s. During this decade, pharmaceutical
      companies started to conduct their own post‐marketing surveillance studies
      and UK guidelines related to their conduct were drawn up in 1987. However,
      initially, the value of such studies turned out to be limited because they
      usually lacked comparator groups and often failed to meet the planned
      sample size. The UK guidelines were revised in 1993 with the aim of
      improving the quality of studies. The principles of the revised Safety
      Assessment of Marketed Medicines (SAMM) guidelines also became a blueprint
      for the first EU level guidance on the topic.
    </p>

    <h2>Development of Pharmacoepidemiology</h2>

    <p>
      Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health
      and disease in populations. During the mid‐1980s, the term
      pharmacoepidemiology was first used to mean the scientific discipline of
      the study of drug use and safety at a population level. The discipline
      developed strongly during the 1990s with the increasing use of
      computerised databases containing records of prescriptions and clinical
      outcomes for rapid and efficient study of potential safety hazards. In
      some instances, prescription records are held in a separate database to
      clinical events, and linkage between the two databases needs to be
      achieved (through common identifiers in the two sets of data) in order to
      study adverse events at an individual patient level.
    </p>

    <p>
      Towards the end of the 1980s, pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology
      started to investigate the problem of dependence on benzodiazepines –
      so‐called minor tranquillisers such as chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and
      diazepam (Valium) which had been introduced in the 1960s. Advice was
      issued to limit the dosage and duration of such treatments and this issue
      brought into focus the problems faced in dealing with the misuse and abuse
      of prescription drugs. This is another example of a situation where
      spontaneous ADR reporting failed to highlight an important concern, the
      issue eventually coming into focus as a result of pressure from advocates
      for groups of affected patients.
    </p>

    <p>
      As well as the problem of delayed identification of real hazards,
      pharmacovigilance has suffered from the reverse, the apparent
      identification of hazards that turn out not to be real. To some extent
      this is inherent in a system that relies much on clinical suspicions
      sometimes these will be wrong. The consequences are that sometimes a drug
      is unnecessarily withdrawn, or people become too scared to use it. For
      example, Debendox (or Bendectin), a combination product containing the
      antihistamine doxylamine, was widely used for the treatment of nausea and
      vomiting in pregnancy in the 1970s. It was withdrawn in the early 1980s on
      the basis of concerns that it might cause fetal malformations, a concerted
      campaign against the drug and impending litigation.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the time, the evidence of a hazard was very weak, but it was not
      possible to exclude a significant risk to the fetus. Subsequently, many
      studies of this potential association were performed and, collectively,
      they provided no evidence of an increased risk of fetal malformations.
      This example illustrates the intrinsic difficulty of disproving the
      existence of a hazard once concern has been raised. A more recent, very
      high profile example illustrating the same point was the suggestion made
      in late 1990s that the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine
      might be a cause of autism in children.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite there being little evidence for this suggestion, it was impossible
      to completely disprove and hard to convince worried parents. Some years
      later the paper that provoked this concern was discredited and retracted
      but in the meantime vaccine campaigns were damaged and a significant
      number of cases of measles occurred in the UK for the first time in many
      years.
    </p>

    <h2>Oral Contraceptives and ‘Pill Scares’</h2>

    <p>
      This major pharmacovigilance story began in the late 1960s when it was
      discovered through spontaneous ADR reporting – and later confirmed in
      formal studies – that combined oral contraceptives (OCs) (containing an
      estrogen and a progestogen) increased the risk of venous thromboembolism
      (VTE). This led to a reduction in the dose of estrogen to 20–30 µg
      ethinylestradiol, which lessened (but did not abolish) the risk without
      compromising efficacy. Nevertheless, when the risk of thrombosis became
      public knowledge (highlighted by media ‘pill scare’ stories in some
      countries), many women became very worried and stopped taking OCs. When
      OCs are stopped abruptly by sexually active women, without immediate use
      of an effective alternative, unintended pregnancies occur and rates of
      induced abortion increase.
    </p>

    <p>
      There have been several ‘pill scares’ over the years related to VTE and
      also to other safety issues such as a possible association with myocardial
      infarction and a small increase in the risk of breast cancer. In each of
      these scares, many women stopped using OCs and the public health impact,
      in terms of unintended pregnancies, was considerable.
    </p>

    <p>
      This has been particularly unfortunate because pregnancy itself is riskier
      (with higher rates of VTE for example) than using any OC. In 1995, a World
      Health Organization (WHO) study of OCs found a twofold increase in the
      risk of VTE when use of third‐generation (3G) OCs was compared with
      second‐generation (2G) OCs. The difference between these pills was the
      progestagen component; desogestrel or gestodene for 3G OCs and
      levonorgestrel for 2G OCs.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was surprising, as it had always been considered that VTE risk was
      simply related to the dose of estrogen in the pill. Within about 3 months
      of the WHO study, the results of two other studies reached similar
      conclusions. Arguments were put forward that the associations seen in
      these studies were not necessarily causal and that 3G OCs might have
      benefits that would compensate for the increase in VTE risk. However,
      there was general agreement that although the relative risk of VTE was
      doubled with 3G pills, the absolute level of risk (see Chapter 2) was very
      low, as VTE is rare in healthy young women, even if they take the pill.
      Thus, there was general agreement that 3G OCs should not be withdrawn from
      the market.
    </p>

    <p>
      The UK’s Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) decided that the emerging
      information on VTE risk should be shared with doctors and patients, but
      faced several challenges around communicating the risks of the OC pill.
      Scare stories had already been published in the British press and despite
      CSM messages that no one should stop taking OCs, many women did, and
      hundreds of unintended pregnancies subsequently occurred. It seemed that
      women had acted on information provided by the mainstream media, rather
      than on advice provided by a national medicines advisory committee.
      Interestingly, the pill scare that occurred in the UK in 1995 was not seen
      in other countries, even those where use of OCs is high. There could be
      many reasons for this, including the role of the British press in risk
      communication.
    </p>

    <p>
      Following the 1995 pill scare, more studies were carried out and the
      effects of the various progestagens on blood clotting investigated.
      Ultimately, it was shown that there were plausible differential effects of
      these agents on clotting and further pharmacoepidemiological studies have
      now convinced most scientists that the observed association was causal and
      that 2G pills have the lowest risk of VTE. It has also been acknowledged
      that the risk communication tools used in 1995 were inadequate and, in
      many respects, pharmacovigilance risk communication at that time failed to
      prevent serious public health outcomes. In 1997, the WHO convened a
      meeting of experts to consider how communication in pharmacovigilance
      could be improved (see Chapter 4). Since then, there have been other
      significant developments in risk communication for all medicinal products
      and many of these have been informed by lessons learned from OC pill
      scares.
    </p>

    <h3>Main Lessons Learned from the OC Safety Issues</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Drugs are sometimes marketed at a higher dose than is required for
        efficacy.
      </li>
      <li>
        There may be differences in safety between drugs of the same class.
      </li>
      <li>Harm can result from poor communication of safety warnings.</li>
      <li>
        When communicating risks of medicines, it is important to distinguish
        between relative and absolute risks (see Chapter 2) and to explain the
        difference in plain language.
      </li>
      <li>Uncertainty and debate about risks can fuel public concern.</li>
      <li>
        The power of the media to influence users may be greater than the
        authorities.
      </li>
      <li>
        The need for greater international cooperation in pharmacovigilance.
      </li>
      <li>The need to develop more effective communication tools.</li>
      <li>Risk communication is a specific skill in pharmacovigilance.</li>
      <li>
        An important point about the OC issues discussed is that the data on
        which they were based did not, after the initial signal in the 1960s,
        come from spontaneous ADR reporting. Despite that, causation was
        debatable because the studies were not randomised trials but
        observational pharmacoepidemiology studies. VTE is a sufficiently rare
        outcome in young women that it would be extremely difficult to conduct a
        large enough randomized clinical trial to detect a doubling of risk.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hormone Replacement Therapy (Menopausal Hormone Therapy)</h2>

    <p>
      Later in life, women have also been prescribed sex hormones as replacement
      therapy (HRT, now renamed menopausal hormone therapy; MHT). In this age
      group, the baseline risks of VTE, arterial cardiovascular disease and
      various cancers are much greater and therefore it has been more feasible
      to study them in clinical trials, although studies have needed to be large
      and long‐term. Therefore, observational studies of these outcomes were
      performed first and, in general, they appeared to show that HRT reduced
      the risk of arterial disease outcomes such as myocardial infarction and
      stroke. HRT was never authorised for the purpose of reducing
      cardiovascular risk, but in the 1980s and 1990s, on the basis of results
      from observational studies and much pharmaceutical company promotion, it
      was widely used for this purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fundamental problem in performing such studies is that women using HRT
      may be healthier to start with and it is difficult to address all possible
      confounding factors (see Glossary) in the design and analysis of
      observational studies. Another important point is that the outcome in
      question is a benefit (i.e. a reduction in risk) and, because of such
      biases (see Glossary), observational studies rarely provide convincing
      evidence of benefit. It is generally accepted that randomised trials are
      needed to establish efficacy and benefit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually, large randomised trials of HRT were set up (e.g. the Million
      Women Study), but some studies had to be stopped early because they showed
      the opposite of what was expected – an increase in cardiovascular risk.
      Warnings were then issued by regulatory authorities and, because there is
      no major downside to suddenly stopping HRT, communication was
      intrinsically easier than with OCs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Indeed, the intended effect of the warnings was that women who were
      inappropriately using long‐term HRT should stop taking it. However,
      conveying the right messages was not straightforward because there were
      multiple risks involved, and they are time‐dependent and cannot simply be
      expressed as a proportion (e.g. 1 in 100). In 2007, the UK authorities
      published a report on HRT which included estimates of risk for several
      adverse outcomes, expressed in clear language. Since then, further studies
      of HRT have been published and discussion of the risks and benefits of
      these products continues, and is likely to for some time to come.

    <h2>Selective Serotonin Re‐uptake Inhibitors</h2>

    <p>
      Selective serotonin re‐uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are antidepressants which
      were brought to the market in the late 1980s and have since largely
      replaced older, tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline. The main
      reason why they have done so – apart from effective marketing – is that
      they are less toxic to the heart in overdose (i.e. there is a greater
      margin of safety in relation to dose). Depressed patients are at risk of
      taking an overdose and therefore this is potentially an important
      advantage.
    </p>

    <p>
      There have been two controversial issues with SSRIs: withdrawal reactions
      and a possible increase in the risk of suicide. Problems experienced by
      patients when they stop treatments are often quite difficult to assess
      because they could possibly be related to recurrence of the disease.
      Nevertheless, the potential for SSRIs to produce withdrawal reactions was
      identified during their development, and when spontaneous reports were
      received post‐marketing it was hardly a new signal (see Glossary). There
      were very large numbers of such reports received, but few were serious and
      the level of usage of the drugs was high. Over a period of years it became
      clear that the problem was occurring much more commonly than initially
      thought, particularly in users of paroxetine (Seroxat), a fairly
      short‐acting drug. Ultimately, greater care was needed in withdrawing
      patients more gradually from these drugs. Suggestions have been made that
      SSRIs are drugs of dependence but most scientists do not accept this
      because features such as craving and dose‐escalation are generally absent.
      Importantly, it emerged that the nature of some of the more unpleasant
      symptoms patients experienced – such as ‘electric shock’ sensations in the
      head – was being lost in the data processing systems. This was often a
      result of inadequate coding. Such cases often became ‘paraesthesia’(a
      tingling or prickling sensation), something that hardly conveys how
      unpleasant such sensations can be.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, it was recognised that we needed better ways to capture unusual
      patient experiences and this gave considerable impetus to allowing
      patients to report their adverse reactions to the authorities. That
      approach had been used in the USA and some other countries for many years,
      but hardly at all in Europe until the early years of the twenty‐first
      century.
    </p>

    <p>
      The possibility that any drug might increase the risk of an outcome
      associated with the disease it is being used to treat is invariably
      difficult to evaluate. Suicidal feelings and actions are relatively common
      in depressed patients and it is not surprising when they occur in a
      patient who has recently started treatment. Nevertheless, around 1990, a
      clinician in the USA saw several patients treated with fluoxetine (Prozac)
      who had suicidal thoughts and he published a case series suggesting that
      the drug might be responsible. This prompted a review of all the clinical
      trial data for the drug which did not support the proposition, but it was
      never completely refuted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years more clinical trial data accumulated for various drugs in
      the class and studies were conducted in children and adolescents, the
      latter being a high‐risk group for suicide. Even in severely depressed
      patients, completed suicides are rare in clinical trials and therefore the
      evidence available relates mostly to attempted suicide (also uncommon in
      trials) and thoughts of suicide measured on various scales. Trials of
      paroxetine in children produced adverse findings – an increased risk of
      suicidal behaviour and hostility – which for some time were known only to
      the manufacturer. When the regulatory authorities eventually received the
      data, they issued warnings against the use of this drug in children. The
      company was investigated and prosecution considered, but the law was found
      to be insufficiently clear that the company was obliged to submit
      concerning clinical trial data immediately to the authorities when a trial
      was being conducted outside the authorised indication. Again, this issue
      pointed to the potential importance of clinical trials in the assessment
      of safety and raised concern about a lack of transparency with clinical
      trial data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Considerable steps have since been taken towards making clinical trial
      data publicly available through mechanisms other than publication in the
      literature which is slow and selective. There is still some uncertainty as
      to whether SSRIs directly increase the risk of suicide in adults, but
      there is general agreement that the early phase of treatment is a
      high‐risk period and that careful monitoring of patients is required.
    </p>

    <h2>COX‐2 Inhibitors</h2>

    <p>
      What have been the most prominent drug safety issues of the twenty-first
      century? One of the most important has been the increased risk of
      cardiovascular outcomes associated with selective COX‐2 inhibitors
      (coxibs). This possibility was first uncovered in basic research but not
      followed through. The first clinical indication of a problem came from the
      VIGOR trial which was published in 2000. At the time, two drugs in the
      class – rofecoxib and celecoxib – had just been authorised.
    </p>

    <p>
      The VIGOR study was a randomised comparison of rofecoxib with naproxen (a
      standard NSAID), designed to establish whether there was a difference in
      the rates of serious gastrointestinal adverse effects (e.g. bleeding) of
      these two drugs. In that respect, rofecoxib was clearly preferable and the
      trial results led to rapid uptake of coxibs, on the basis that they were
      supposedly safer. However, the VIGOR study also found an important
      difference in the rate of cardiovascular events such as myocardial
      infarction which were five‐fold more common in patients taking rofecoxib
      than with naproxen. This information was included in the original
      publication but lacked prominence and was presented as a fivefold
      reduction with naproxen rather than an increase with rofecoxib. The paper
      was subsequently the subject of extensive criticism.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years there have been suggestions that standard NSAIDs reduce the
      risk of cardiovascular outcomes (as aspirin does) and a potential
      explanation for the finding in the VIGOR study put forward was that
      naproxen is cardioprotective whereas rofecoxib is not. Ultimately, it took
      a large clinical trial comparing rofecoxib with placebo to establish
      beyond any doubt that this was an adverse effect of rofecoxib (rather than
      a lack of benefit) and the findings of that study led to the drug being
      withdrawn from the market in late 2004.
    </p>

    <p>
      This event sent shockwaves around the world leading people to question why
      such a trial had not been carried out much earlier, before millions of
      people had used the drug. It also left a big cloud hanging over the
      remaining drugs in the class; some were later withdrawn but some remain on
      the market. At one stage, the proposition that coxibs might be given to
      people at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and low risk of
      cardiovascular disease seemed reasonable, but it has since been discovered
      that, to a considerable extent, risk factors for these problems overlap in
      individual patients. To make matters even more complicated, it appears
      that some standard NSAIDs also increase the risk of cardiovascular events
      and the ability to assess the relative safety of drugs in the same class
      remains rather limited. This issue was a major driver of the considerable
      increase in post‐marketing regulation, and focus on post‐authorisation
      safety studies, which came to fruition in Europe in 2012 and is discussed
      in Chapter 5.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two other notable drug safety issues of recent years are also important:
      the differing hazards associated with three glitazone drugs used to treat
      type 2 diabetes, and the association of pandemic flu vaccine with
      narcolepsy.
    </p>

    <h2>Glitazones</h2>

    <p>
      Troglitazone was the first of the three glitazones to be marketed in the
      late 1990s. These drugs are oral hypoglycaemics which work by activating
      peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors (PPARs). Soon after marketing,
      a considerable number of case reports of severe hepa-toxicity with
      associated liver failure were received and the drug was rapidly withdrawn
      in Europe. At the time, the next in class, rosiglitazone, was in the later
      stages of development and regulatory authorities therefore considered very
      carefully whether it might also be associated with a similar level of
      hepatotoxicity. They concluded (and were eventually proven right) that it
      was probably different in this regard. Rosiglitazone became a very widely
      used drug in the first few years of the twenty‐first century and it was
      soon followed by pioglitazone. Studies of cardiovascular risk were
      performed with these drugs in the expectation that an effective
      anti‐diabetic drug would reduce the risk. However, when these studies were
      brought together in a meta‐analysis (which combines the results of
      multiple studies; see Chapter 3) published in 2007, the opposite appeared
      to be the case for rosiglitazone. This concern was the subject of
      considerable debate and further study but, within a couple of years, it
      led to the demise of the drug. Much of that debate was about its relative
      cardiovascular safety compared with pioglitazone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given that the benefits of the two drugs appeared broadly equal, and that
      most of the available evidence suggested that pioglitazone was safer, it
      was allowed to remain on the market. Interestingly, pioglitazone also
      appears to be associated with its own particular important safety problem,
      bladder cancer. This was originally identified in animal studies and in
      the last few years has been confirmed in humans.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the level of risk is quite low, and considered manageable and to
      be outweighed by the benefits of the drug in effectively treating type 2
      diabetes. The safety issues experienced with glitazones are remarkable.
      Despite the apparent similarities of the drugs, they appear to be
      associated with different important adverse effects affecting different
      organs.
    </p>

    <h2>Pandemrix</h2>

    <p>
      In 2009, there was an influenza pandemic reflecting the global spread of a
      new strain of human flu H1N1 virus. In many countries, mass vaccinations
      were undertaken with Pandemrix. In Finland and Sweden, case reports of a
      vaccinated children and adolescents developing narcolepsy – a brain
      disorder causing episodes of sudden onset of sleep at inappropriate times
      – were soon received. Formal studies have since confirmed this as a rare
      risk but only in young people, and the mechanism for this effect remains
      unclear. The effect has therefore been recognised in the product
      information and it has been recommended that this vaccine should no longer
      be used in patients under 20 years unless no other suitable vaccine is
      available. This example illustrates the effectiveness of the intensive ADR
      monitoring systems which were put in place to cover mass vaccinations
      during a pandemic in picking up an unusual and important adverse reaction.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>

    <p>
      The issues discussed are necessarily selective and our discussion of them
      is broad. The intention is primarily to illustrate that pharmacovigilance
      experienced many teething problems in its early years and that most of its
      developments have been in response to quite specific lessons learned from
      landmark safety issues. In this chapter, we have tried to illustrate what
      pharmacovigilance is and, by describing important examples, how it has
      progressed over a period of more than half a century. Despite that
      progress, no one should doubt that there is still a long way to go. The
      current limitations of the discipline and how we might eventually overcome
      them are considered in Chapter 9.

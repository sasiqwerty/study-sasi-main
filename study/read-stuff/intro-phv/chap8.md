# Ethical and Societal Considerations

We now consider wider societal aspects of the safety of medicines, starting by identifying the main stakeholders and their perspectives. There is an important ethical dimension to pharmacovigilance - medicines are supposed to be beneficial and yet we know that harms will occur despite best efforts to prevent them.

In the past, much information about the safety of medicines remained within companies and was only shared with regulators when required. Steps to improve transparency have been made both in terms of process and access to the relevant data, both in the pre‐ and post‐licensing phases of drug development. Potential conflicts of interest are increasingly recognised as very important and need to be handled appropriately.

Ethics committees continue to discuss the balance between benefit to society and possible harm to individuals. At times, public confidence in government systems has not been high - there has been criticism that regulators and industry are too cosy, and that patients’ interests do not always come first.

The media watch from a distance, waiting for something interesting to happen.

## Stakeholders and Their Perspectives

The most important stakeholders in pharmacovigilance are patients who use medicines - this is, after all, why the discipline exists. Health professionals are also ‘users’ of the medicines they prescribe and both probably have similar expectations of the process. Broadly speaking, users of medicines expect them to have been adequately tested, to be effective and ‘safe’ in the sense that serious harms are unlikely to occur, and to be provided with appropriate and understandable information about their use. These are in essence the goals of the regulatory process, but because of limitations that largely have a scientific basis there is a gap between expectation and reality. Patients know that side effects can occur with medicines, but generally perceive these as likely to be transient or reversible and non‐serious. When a life‐threatening reaction occurs with a treatment given for a relatively trivial indication, they are shocked. The prescribing doctor might be too, because he or she has unintentionally broken one of the first rules of medicine - primum non nocere (first, do no harm). By contrast, personnel working in drug safety, whether they are in industry, a regulator or in academia, may be unsurprised.

Patients exist not only as individuals but in groups (i.e. patient organisations) and such bodies have an important role in educating and supporting individuals who develop specific (usually chronic) diseases. Generally, patient organisations are more focused on access to treatments than on safety considerations and their perspective may well be that the need for and potential benefits of treatments outweigh quite major risks. Some patient groups are specifically based on the victims of particular treatments (e.g. there is still a prominent thalidomide action group in the UK) and they may be seeking to achieve recognition of a problem, regulatory measures against the drug or compensation for affected individuals.

Vaccines are a particularly sensitive area for understandable reasons - they are usually given to healthy individuals and often to children. One of the reasons for administering them as widely as possible may also be a benefit to society rather than the individual (i.e. ‘herd’ immunity). This raises an ethical dilemma if serious harms are possible. Perhaps for such reasons vaccines are unusual in that some attempts to compensate victims directly (i.e. without litigation) have been made. In most countries, society does not compensate victims of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) unless they are prepared to litigate. To win they are likely to have to prove individual causation, to demonstrate they were personally harmed by the treatment (this may be intrinsically difficult as was discussed in Chapter 2) and possibly also that the manufacturer did not take all reasonable steps to identify and prevent such harm. Litigation about medicines is a major industry in itself and extremely good business for lawyers who may actively advertise for cases (there are many such sites online) and pursue mass actions which are quite often settled out of court by companies as a means of damage limitation. Government health ministers are ultimately responsible for the overall system, but politicians generally avoid involvement - there is little in it for them but a potential minefield.
When an unexpected major drug safety issue arises, it is good copy and likely to receive a very high profile in the media. Hindsight will be liberally applied - surely this could have been predicted or avoided? - and the company and/or regulators are likely to be blamed.

The plight of individual victims is highlighted, but media and public interest will generally be transient. The media see their role as to inform and entertain and vary considerably in their approach, but common to all is a focus on what they perceive will attract their customers (i.e. what ‘sells newspapers’). Drug safety matters will usually do so, but some elements of the matter (e.g. uncertainties and difficult judgements) are often handled badly or ignored.

Media coverage may unnecessarily scare some people into inappropriate action (as in the Pill scares discussed in Chapter 1) but pharmacovigilance personnel should not lose sight of the potential positive power of their influence. Indeed, better handling of the media should be on their agenda. It is certainly worth sitting down with more responsible sections of the media and explaining what the problem is and discussing how they can help. Ultimately, anything that may lead to well‐balanced coverage and clear, appropriate messages is worth pursuing.

In terms of trying to prevent unnecessary drug safety scares, it is worth bearing in mind recognised ‘fright factors’ - these are aspects of a particular risk that will tend to make most people more risk-averse. In particular, we tend to be more frightened by risks that are:

- Involuntarily taken
- Man‐made
- Irreversible
- Poorly understood.

Many serious ADRs will meet all of these criteria, meaning that it is very easy for the public to become more scared than is appropriate and to lose sight of the balancing benefits. For example, following concerns that use of human insulins might mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia in the early 1990s, some patients stopped taking insulin altogether.

All the parties mentioned are stakeholders in the process of pharmacovigilance, but usually lawyers and the media only become involved when a problem has already occurred. Industry personnel, regulators, researchers, non‐governmental organisations (see Chapter 6) and individual users (i.e. patients/health professionals as discussed in Chapter 7) between them have the potential to prevent some specific problems occurring - the ultimate purpose of pharmacovigilance - whereas other stakeholders may influence the system or endeavour to promote change later in the process.

## Ethical Principles

As should be clear from the discussions above, there are many potential tensions in the drug safety system - such as risk versus benefit, individual versus population good, potential therapeutic gain from innovation versus uncertainty. These are set against a background of commercial and political imperatives, the latter largely being the economics of healthcare. The need for an ethical approach and ethical safeguards is therefore manifest.

In terms of researching the safety of medicines in human subjects, there is an overarching code of ethical principles - the Declaration of Helsinki - which was originally developed under the auspices of the World Medical Association (WMA) in 1964. Since that time there have been several significant revisions to the Declaration and the current version (2013) is the only official one, replacing all earlier versions.

The Declaration of Helsinki is based on principles outlined in the WMA Declaration of Geneva which binds the physician with the words, ‘The health of my patient will be my first consideration’, and the International Code of Medical Ethics which declares that ‘A physician shall act in the patient’s best interest when providing medical care.’

In the context of safety, the most important of the 37 points currently included in the Declaration of Helsinki are as follows:

- While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.
- All medical research involving human subjects must be preceded by careful assessment of predictable risks and burdens to the individuals and groups involved in the research in comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or groups affected by the condition under investigation.

- Measures to minimise the risks must be implemented. The risks must be continuously monitored, assessed and documented by the researcher.
- Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects.

These have an underlying theme: individual patient safety is paramount. However, another key theme in the Declaration of Helsinki is consideration of the balance between the likely common good (future benefit to society) and the risk of harm to the individual when undertaking medical research. In pharmacovigilance, risk-benefit trade-offs made at the population level usually accept that some individuals will lose out. Essentially, a judgement is being made that more good than harm will occur in the population in the full knowledge that some harms cannot be prevented.

## Informed Consent

When experimental research is being conducted (i.e. there is an intervention that would not occur in ordinary practice), informed consent is essential. On this point, the Declaration of Helsinki states ‘Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent as subjects in medical research must be voluntary. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees.’ Issues become more complex when an individual is unable to give informed consent to be involved in research; for example, if they are too young, have a condition impeding their competency to consent or have died. Protocols involving these situations are usually referred to ethics committees for advice.

For non‐interventional research (i.e. observational studies), consent of individuals has generally not been required and often may not be feasible, for example in large data‐linkage studies. However, in today’s environment of increasing importance of individual rights, most ethics committees will ask researchers to justify why informed consent should not be obtained for observational research. In addition to feasibility and methodological issues (e.g. if seeking consent would bias the results as people who agree to consent may differ from those who refuse) there is again the overriding ethical question of whether the common societal good overrides individual perspectives and if so, when? This is relevant, for example, to whether or not patient consent is required for ADR reporting and epidemiological research. To date, it has been generally agreed that individual consent is not required for submitting ADR reports, as this is in the common good and is also part of good clinical practice (so is not strictly ‘research’ although research may later be performed on the anonymised population data). However, during the clinical consultation most health professionals are likely to inform the patient they are submitting the ADR report and the individual has the right to opt out of this process if they so wish.

## Privacy and Confidentiality

The patient’s right to privacy is a key issue and individual patient data need to be held securely and treated with respect. Research protocols need to specify measures for keeping individual data private and confidential during studies and these principles also apply in post-marketing pharmacovigilance practice. Often it is necessary to de‐identify personal data for research purposes and no individual should be identifiable when results are shared with authorities or published. While there is a general statement about privacy and confidentiality in the Declaration of Helsinki, it should be noted that legislation varies considerably between countries and this needs to be considered when performing international pharmacoepidemiology research.

## Ethical Issues for the Pharmaceutical Industry

There are various other specific ethical issues that face industry personnel and are relevant to safety. For example:

- Ethical promotion of drugs, given the potential link between safety and promotion.
- Public representation of data (e.g. the temptation towards suppression of unfavourable data or expert opinions).
- Drug pricing and availability, especially in the developing world, may lead to use of less safe medicines.
- Control over publication of results that were unfavourable in terms of efficacy or safety.

## Ethical Safeguards in Relation to Safety

The safeguards in place to protect patient safety can broadly be considered on the following four levels.

#### Legislation, Voluntary Codes and Guidelines

Many of the issues discussed are addressed in the framework of medicines legislation in each country, in international codes such as the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH guidance (see Chapter 6) and in national and regional ethical guidelines. The pharmaceutical industry also has some voluntary codes (e.g. in relation to advertising practices), as do health professionals, whose professional bodies have developed codes and guidelines for ethical practice.

#### Ethics Committees/Review Boards

Ethics committees operate nationally or regionally and the role of such committees is to consider ethical aspects of specific research proposals. Committee membership is usually comprised of both expert (medical or scientific) and lay representatives and in many countries meetings are open in order to increase transparency. Their key task is to protect study participants by reviewing research protocols and any amendments that may be necessary once the study is under way.
Many studies presented to ethics committee involve evaluation of the safety of medicines, either in pre‐licensing clinical trials or in studies of marketed medicines. Some of the key ethical issues in such studies are as follows:

- There may be no benefit to the study participant (especially for first‐in‐man studies or other new indication studies) and this is an important difference to benefit-risk assessment in clinical practice.
- The risks of the medicines to be administered in the study need to be clearly stated and explained, including frequencies of ADRs (if known from previous studies) and possible outcomes for the participant.
- Any risks to special or vulnerable populations (e.g. pregnant women, children or the elderly) need to be clearly stated and justified.
- Issues relating to participants who are unable to provide informed consent for interventional studies (e.g. unconscious patients, those with cognitive impairment).
- Researchers need to outline what they will do to minimise risk to the study participants.
- Participants must be informed of the possible risks in clear information sheets written in lay language.

#### Data Monitoring Committees

These should be set up for interventional studies in order to protect subjects from safety hazards which might only become evident during the course of the study. Depending on the study and the risks involved, the data monitoring committee can be an informal local group or a full external committee. These groups should be run independently of the sponsor and operate separately from those involved in the day‐today operation of the trial. A data monitoring committee looks at the safety data sequentially as it emerges and can recommend that the trial be stopped on safety grounds if it becomes clear that patients in one treatment arm are at greater risk of a serious hazard than those in the other arm(s).

#### Publication

Much (but not all) medical research will eventually be published in the scientific literature. The publication process for most international journals involves peer review which thereby provides another ethical safeguard for research practice. However, publication is selective (and therefore biased) depending on:

1. What the results show - positive research is more likely to published than something that failed to observe a clear effect ( commonly referred to as publication bias).
2. Choices made by researchers and editors - as with other forms of media, decisions are made regarding what is topical and of interest to readers.

Aside from the issue of non‐publication (or delayed publication) of some research findings, there is also the problem of misconduct. There are many potential types of misconduct relating to publication, the most serious of which are plagiarism, fraud or fabrication. Steps have been taken to address these problems in part through the setting up of a Committee on Publication Ethics which now operates worldwide. This has drawn up guidelines intended to encourage intellectual honesty, prevent and deal with misconduct and provide advice on when research papers should be retracted.

### Transparency

In the past, drug safety was, like many other processes involving regulated industry, essentially non‐transparent. Users were expected to accept that behind the scenes people were doing their best and with the right motives. Commercial sensitivity was another reason given for a lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical industry. The move towards greater transparency which gained impetus during the 1990s was not specific to this field, but part of a wider societal desire to know more of what was going on. Governments have also seen advantages in opening up such processes, in terms of public confidence in systems and in increasing the credibility of their decisions and advice. This change in approach has been facilitated by developments in electronic communication. Thus, general public policy on freedom of information began to override the potential commercial considerations that were for a long time the main putative reason for secrecy. It is now generally accepted that drug safety information rarely has real commercial value to competitors.

The following is a list of some of the major types of safety data which may now be freely available:

- Published scientific literature
- Warnings on specific issues (e.g. from companies or regulatory bodies)
- Drug safety bulletins (e.g. from regulators or other professional bodies)
- Press releases
- Public assessment reports on specific issues (e.g. from regulatory bodies)
- Searchable ADR databases
- Clinical trial protocols and data.

The ordering of the list is chronological in the sense that 50 years ago only information published in the scientific literature was available and that the others have been introduced at various time points since then. The requirement for registration of clinical trials is surprisingly recent (early 2000s) and there is still scope for further development (e.g. only summaries of risk management plans have so far been made public) and in most countries, regulatory discussions are still held behind closed doors.

Timing of release of information is important because it is reasonable to be concerned that premature release before considered recommendations can be made could do more harm than good. There is also concern that complex information might be misunderstood and there is a need to improve delivery with the goal of aiding better understanding according the needs of the recipient.
Besides the information on which judgements and decisions are based, there is a need for transparency of process. In this respect the public need to know:

- Who reached the decision?
- What was the basis for the decision?
- Was the decision challenged?
- Why was another course of action not chosen?

## Conflicts of Interest

The realisation that we all have conflicts of interest and attempts to deal with them is a surprisingly recent phenomenon. It was only at the beginning of the twenty‐first century that one of the major journals in the field introduced a clear policy in relation to the need for declaration of such conflicts. Drug safety is now a very sensitive area in this respect because difficult judgements have to be made about the risk of serious harms and these have financial consequences for the company involved. The public need to be convinced that those making the judgements are uninfluenced by such considerations and yet academic experts in the field are ubiquitously associated with, and their research is often funded by, the industry. In dealing with conflicts of interest, transparency and public credibility are the key issues.

There is general agreement that financial conflicts of interest must be disclosed and that persons with important conflicts should not influence relevant decisions. All organisations conducting pharmacovigilance work should have policies on how conflicts of interest should be handled. A useful categorisation of financial conflicts developed by regulators is to consider whether they are:

- Personal (consultancy fees, shares) or
- Non‐personal (e.g. funding to a university department) and
- Specific (to the drug/issue at hand) or
- Non‐specific (e.g. related to other drugs made by the same company).

Using such a system provides for four categories, and interests that are both personal and specific represent the highest level of conflict. These should result in exclusion of an expert from giving advice to regulators. Conversely, a non‐personal, non‐specific interest is at the lowest level and usually only requires declaration. Such systems are necessary because, in practical terms, regulators or other authorities may not have access to the necessary expertise if they simply excluded all experts who had any kind of conflict.

Other competing interests (e.g. non‐financial) are also possible and systems are less well developed in dealing with them. Involvement with competitor products/companies, indirect potential conflicts via personal associations (through family or work) and past interests which might be considered lapsed, are examples of such grey areas.

## Conclusions

In this chapter we have outlined broad ethical and societal considerations that impact on pharmacovigilance. We have discussed the perspectives of the relevant stakeholders and how they impact on aspects of societal behaviour when drug safety issues occur. General ethical principles and guidance are drawn from the Declaration of Helsinki and a balance is required between protecting individuals and the common good. There are some specific issues for research studies involving medicines, and ethics committees continue to be important in protecting participants from harm. To support system credibility, the need for transparency of drug safety information and processes is generally accepted, while protecting the privacy of individuals.

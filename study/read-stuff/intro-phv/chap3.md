The safety of medicines is under evaluation throughout the drug development cycle. This process starts before humans are exposed, and continues during the clinical development and post‐marketing phases. Broadly, the safety of a medicine is tested in four phases, each of which produces different types of data:

1. Pre‐clinical (animal) studies
2. Healthy human volunteer studies (Phase I)
3. Clinical trials (Phases II and III)
4. Post‐marketing surveillance (Phase IV)

Although there is a natural sequence defined by the above order, the phases are not entirely distinct. Sometimes, new pre‐clinical studies are undertaken for authorised products and, as we saw in Chapter 1, clinical trials are increasingly becoming important post‐marketing.

Systematic reviews and meta‐analysis are important tools for bringing together data from multiple studies. Although they have usually been applied in the assessment of efficacy, their use for safety purposes is increasing.

## Pre‐clinical Studies

Pre‐clinical studies are usually conducted in rodents (rabbit, mouse, rat) and dogs or primates (monkeys). They aim to establish dosage levels below which toxicity is not observed and to identify the organs
adversely affected by higher doses. The most important potential effects studied are:

- Major organ toxicity
- Acute and chronic toxicity
- Carcinogenicity
- Mutagenicity (i.e. able to induce genetic mutation)
- Teratogenicity (i.e. producing physical defects in the embryo).

Even at this stage, some adverse effects might be acceptable, depending on the ultimate target population for the drug. For example, adverse reproductive effects could be considered less important for a drug that is to be used exclusively in an elderly population.

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) may not be specific to particular species. When studies in animals demonstrate major toxicity, further drug development is usually precluded and the level of toxicity in humans remains unknown. When no major toxicity has been demonstrated in animals, development can proceed into humans but some ADRs appear to be specific to humans (e.g. the multi‐system oculomucocutaneous syndrome caused by the beta‐blocker practolol). It is generally accepted that thalidomide teratogenicity was not predictable from animal studies.

Generally, the predictive value of pre‐clinical studies for human toxicity is not more than moderate and discussions continue about the relevance of these studies to human use. Overall, they provide only limited reassurance that use in humans will be acceptably safe.

## Human Volunteer Studies (Phase I)

For most medicines, the first human exposure takes place in healthy volunteers but cytotoxic drugs used to treat cancers are an exception.
Participants are very closely monitored with clinical supervision and resuscitation equipment must be immediately to hand. The purposes are to establish a possible dosage regimen, investigate how the drug is handled by the body and what the effects are on a variety of standard parameters (e.g. pulse and blood pressure, ECG, haematology). Assuming the drug appears to have no major untoward effects, it can then be studied in clinical trials that include patients with the target disease(s).
Healthy volunteer (or Phase I) studies have generally had a good safety record over a long period of time but, occasionally, major adverse reactions do occur.

In 2006, all six of the first humans treated with the monoclonal antibody TGN1412 in London rapidly developed multi‐organ failure. The incident was investigated in detail by the UK regulatory authority who concluded that the reactions were an unexpected biological effect. A further unexpected and serious incident occurred in France in 2016 when administration of escalating doses of BIA 10‐2474, a fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor, to healthy volunteers led to one death and three cases of serious neurological damage in healthy volunteers. In that instance, about 80 people had previously been given the drug without similar effects being observed.

## Clinical Trials (Phase II and III Studies)

Clinical trials are usually designed to study both efficacy and safety, but efficacy is usually the primary end‐point. The design of such trials incorporates various features to minimise bias such as randomisation to treatment groups, blinding of subjects and observers/investigators to treatment allocation, and validated measurement instruments.

Initially, fairly small Phase II trials are conducted; these tend to be focused on efficacy and dosage requirements. Larger Phase III trials are then conducted and form the key element of the safety database prior to marketing. All adverse events occurring in patients after exposure to the drug and a comparator (which can be a placebo or an alternative active drug) are systematically recorded. In order to minimise measurement bias, it is usual to ‘blind’ all study participants (i.e. patients and clinicians, which is known as ‘double blinding’) to the treatments given or, if that is not possible, to ‘blind’ those who are involved in assessing the outcomes (a form of ‘single blinding’), particularly if there is any subjectivity involved.

In clinical trials, the data are analysed to identify adverse events that occur at significantly higher rates on the medicinal product of interest than on comparators. Usually, the data from all pre‐licensing trials are pooled in a global safety analysis for presentation to regulatory authorities. Clinical trials will identify most common adverse reactions but often have important limitations, including:

- Selection of patients – those at greatest risk of ADRs, or those who have not responded to similar medicines, are often excluded.
- Study size – the numbers of patients studied is generally not enough to identify rare but serious ADRs.
- The artificial conditions – patients are likely to be more closely monitored than in real life.
- Measurement of surrogate markers of effect rather than ‘hard’
- end‐points.
- The duration of follow‐up is usually short, weeks or months rather than years.

At the conclusion of a clinical trial, patients may be continued on the treatment and followed‐up for a period of months or years, generating more long‐term safety experience. These are known as ‘open-label’ extensions as it known which treatment is being taken. When clinical trials are conducted entirely after marketing, they may provide important new safety information, provided that they contain enough patients, have few exclusion criteria and clinically relevant outcomes that are easily measured (e.g. mortality). Such studies are often called ‘large simple trials’.

During the clinical trial phase of drug development, there is a major safety focus on the protection of trial participants. Investigators are obliged to document and report serious adverse events promptly. If a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction (SUSAR; see Chapter 5) occurs, then the case should be unblinded and reported to regulatory authorities. The identification of a serious new hazard may lead to a trial – or even the whole development programme – being stopped. In all clinical trials there should be safety monitoring arrangements in place (including a data monitoring committee) to oversee unblinded safety results as they emerge, possibly in accordance with a pre‐planned series of sequential analyses. Care needs to be taken so that such procedures do not compromise the integrity of the trial, but the need to ensure that trial participants are not exposed to unnecessary risk is paramount. In this respect there is an ethical dimension to safety in trials, and in most countries clinical studies require ethics committee approval before commencement. Ethical issues are considered further in Chapter 8.

## Post‐marketing Surveillance (Phase IV Studies)

Because of the limitations of pre‐marketing studies, safety can only be regarded as provisional when a new medicine is first marketed. There is a need to collect more evidence arising from ‘real world’ usage, which differs from use of the medicine in a clinical trial in several important ways, including larger and different populations exposed and less formal monitoring. Spontaneous ADR reporting is generally regarded as the cornerstone of such monitoring and its main purpose is for the detection of ‘signals’ of previously unrecognised hazards (see Chapter 4): hypothesis generation. Formal pharmacoepidemiological studies should then be designed to investigate and characterise serious possible ADRs: hypothesis testing.

The extent to which the safety of a new drug can be studied post-marketing depends considerably on how much it is used. If uptake is slow, then it may be some time before there is sufficient exposure to conduct a formal study. On the other hand, if uptake is rapid, then many people may suffer the consequences of an important safety problem while it is being identified and investigated.

## Spontaneous ADR Reporting Systems

The primary purpose of spontaneous ADR reporting is to provide early warnings or ‘signals’ of previously unrecognised drug toxicity. As discussed in Chapter 1, the method was developed in the 1960s in response to the thalidomide tragedy and is now well‐established throughout the developed world and in some developing countries.

Health professionals are the key original source of spontaneous reports, but in recent years patient reporting has become widely accepted, although its value in signal detection is not fully established.

In recent years, electronic transmission of all reports has become the norm between pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities in most countries and is progressing in terms of initial transmission from health professionals in many parts of the world.

Spontaneous ADR reporting can be defined as a scheme for collat-ing individual case reports of suspected ADRs, operated for the primary purpose of detecting unknown, potentially seriously harmful effects of drugs. As discussed in Chapter 2, individual cases can be assessed for causation using established principles. However, except in the very rare circumstance whereby a drug causes a previously unidentified syndrome (i.e. an apparently completely specific drug–event association), a series of spontaneous ADR reports provides only limited evidence of causation. Generally therefore, data from these schemes raise questions rather than provide answers.

Today, many spontaneous ADR reporting systems are in operation around the world and these are generally effective, but they are not a panacea for two main reasons. First, the output is essentially only a ‘signal’, which is a possible association requiring further evaluation and investigation and some signals will inevitably turn out to be false positives (i.e. not related to the drug). Secondly, the method is far from perfect in rapidly detecting all unrecognised ADRs. There will also be false negatives, which are ultimately detected by other methods, e.g. practolol and oculo‐mucocutaneous syndrome, as discussed in Chapter 1.

### Key Elements of Spontaneous Reporting Programmes

Spontaneous ADR reporting is conceptually simple. Reports are submitted on a voluntary basis and information is entered on to a database which is screened regularly for signals. The main elements of a scheme which are essential to its success can be summarised as in the following sections.

#### Health Professionals who are Willing to Participate

The value of a spontaneous report mainly derives from the suspicion of a reporter that a drug may have been responsible for a particular event. Most national programmes now encourage reports from any health professional involved in the patient’s care including doctors, pharmacists, nurses and midwives. When a report is submitted by a patient or carer (or a health professional who is not the patient’s usual carer), there is much to be gained by follow‐up with the patient’s regular doctor (general practitioners in many countries) who usually has the most clinical information about the patient concerned.

Cooperation from clinicians is essential for successful spontaneous reporting schemes and, in practice in most countries, reporting is invariably voluntary. Although some countries have ‘mandatory’ ADR reporting schemes for health professionals, they do not always have markedly higher reporting rates per head of the population, because usually there is no practical mechanism of enforcement. The reasons why some health professionals are prepared to report (and why some countries have much higher rates of reporting) are not fully understood and are likely to be multifactorial, including other elements of reporting schemes.

#### Simplicity in Submission of Reports

If busy health professionals are to submit reports voluntarily, they are only likely to do so if the process is straightforward. Reporting needs to be facilitated by the ready availability of clearly laid out forms which are simple to complete, and internationally agreed standard forms are in wide use. Both paper and electronic forms need to be made available, the former with free postage.

Electronic reporting methods are increasingly important and several national pharmacovigilance centres have now developed apps for phones and other devices. Most centres will accept reports in different forms, including verbally (e.g. by telephone), handwritten (hard copy form) or electronic submission. However, with all methods, an individual case report form should be completed.

#### Prompt Entry of Reports on to a Database

It is important to ensure prompt data entry of reports on to databases to avoid backlogs and to ensure that reports containing vital new information are assessed as soon as possible. Most national schemes have standard operating procedures to ensure timely data entry and evaluation of reports.

Data entry involves coding both the suspect medicine (and concomitant medicines) and the suspected ADR. Standard dictionaries should be used for coding. A drugs dictionary is required for coding medicines and the most commonly used is the one maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO). This uses the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system and contains around 50 000 drugs.

#### Coding and Assessment of ADR Reports

For coding ADRs, international medical terminology dictionaries are used, in particular the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) or the WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology (WHO‐ART).
Other details from the report, for example, patient details (age, sex, etc.), time to onset of the ADR, severity of the reaction and the outcome for the patient, should also be entered into the database.
Whether a full causality assessment is done for each report (see Chapter 4) varies from country to country, as does the degree of clinical assessment of individual reports.

#### Follow‐up of Reports

Reporters may be contacted for follow‐up (i.e. provision of additional detailed clinical information, e.g. results of investigations, autopsy reports) or ascertainment of the outcome subsequent to initial submission. In most schemes, follow‐up is selective, dependent on the perceived importance of a report and the extent to which information important for its evaluation has already been provided. In some schemes, all reporters are contacted after assessment of the initial report, with further information requested as required. A simple principle is that all serious reports should be followed‐up.

#### Analytical Tools to Detect Signals

Analytical methods are now used in many schemes to detect to signals from spontaneously reported ADRs and these are discussed in detail in Chapter 4.

#### Processes for Dealing with Signals

Once a signal has been identified, the next step is to evaluate all the relevant available information, including that derived from other data sources. Because signal evaluation is resource‐intensive and large numbers of signals can be detected in some databases, interim steps have been proposed to prioritise them including triage and impact analysis. These tools and the principles of signal evaluation are discussed in Chapter 4.

#### Feedback to Reporters

In order to complete a feedback loop, information must also flow back to reporters through acknowledgement, provision of data and bulletins describing evaluated signals. Methods of feedback to reporters vary among national centres, but electronic methods are increasingly important.

### Recent Spontaneous Reporting Data from the UK Yellow Card Scheme

To illustrate the nature of the data received through spontaneous ADR reporting in a developed country, we assessed information from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK. In this country, which has a population of around 60 million, the total number of spontaneously reported ADRs has increased in recent years. In 2015, a total of 39 046 reports were received compared to 21 419 in 2006. During this period the proportions of reports received from different sources did not vary greatly. Overall, the proportion received from healthcare professionals was 46%, with 40% being received via the pharmaceutical industry and 14% from patients or their carers. The proportions of reports that were fatal (5%), serious (79%) and non‐serious (16%) were also quite stable.

During the period 2011–2015 more than 1000 reports per year were received in every 10‐year age band up to the age of 90. One of the main age‐related changes in this period has been an increase in children aged 0–10 years, in whom the number of reports has roughly doubled.

During 2011–2015, the system organ classes most commonly used to classify the reported reactions have consistently been general disorders (a category used to cover reactions that do not clearly fit into a specific organ system, e.g. malaise), neurological disorders, gastrointestinal and skin disorders. These data only illustrate what has been reported and may be subject to various biases. For example, it is unlikely that the true frequency of ADRs in young children has increased and the trend in the data is much more likely to represent an effect of steps taken to promote awareness and reporting of ADRs in children.

### Spontaneous Reporting Around the World

Spontaneous reporting schemes are well‐established throughout the developed world and have also been set up in many developing countries. Most national schemes are run by the medicines regulatory agency but other models exist, for example in the Netherlands and in New Zealand, where the monitoring centre is a separate institution.

Some larger countries have regional centres which may serve as a local base for the submission, handling and follow‐up of reports, and/or assist in promoting reporting and education about ADRs. In France, the whole country is covered by such regional centres with a coordinating group based at the French medicines agency. In the UK, only part of the country is covered by regional centres and in other areas reports are submitted and handled centrally.

In most countries, pharmaceutical companies have legal obligations to submit spontaneous adverse reaction reports (see Chapter 5) and these are entered on to the national database. There is some variation among countries as to the proportion of reports that come via the industry (e.g. a large majority do so in Germany, the USA and Singapore, but the proportion is less in the UK). There is a potential for duplication of reports which a clinician submits to both industry and agency and also because more than one clinician can report the same case. A systematic approach to screening databases for duplicates is required and this task has become more difficult as confidentiality restrictions have increased.

International standards for ADR reporting have been developed since the late 1980s through the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) and International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) (see Chapter 6).

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Spontaneous Reporting

The main strengths of spontaneous reporting lie in its simplicity, that it can be universally applied (all drugs, all the time) and in its ability to rapidly capture clinical suspicions that may otherwise to go unrecorded. In theory, spontaneous reporting is cheap to run, although globally much resource is now put into it and, overall, it is not as efficient as it could be because of duplicated efforts.

The main limitations of the method are inevitable and unquantifiable under‐reporting, and the potential for the data to be misunderstood. Curiously, most of the biases affecting the data are actually positive features, which reflect the way these schemes are promoted. Thus, a report is more likely to be submitted if the ADR is serious, unrecognised or relates to a new drug – all features that are desirable. The other major bias – the effect of publicity – is often undesirable but can only occur once a hazard has been recognised by some means. It therefore does not detract from the primary purpose of the method, but it does mean that interpretation of the data during subsequent monitoring is fraught with difficulty.

Misperceptions of the data are common. For example, the information that (say) 50 fatal suspected ADRs have been reported with a particular drug sounds worrying, particularly to lay people. However, this cannot be interpreted without considering carefully several factors, including the nature of the possible ADRs, what the drug is used for, how much it has been used and what other evidence might be available to support a causal link. Spontaneous ADR databases contain a fair amount of background ‘noise’, in that suspected reactions were not actually caused by the drug, but this point is often not appreciated and may lead to misinterpretation of these types of data.

It is important to recognise that spontaneous ADR reporting is most likely to detect signals of relatively rare ADRs when the background incidence of the disease is low. Relatively common ADRs are likely to have been detected earlier in drug development by clinical trials and detecting rare ADRs is difficult when the background incidence of the event is high. This is because clinicians are not surprised to see cases of common diseases (such as myocardial infarction).

Although spontaneous ADR reporting is a well‐established method, both the utility of the schemes and the data they generate are frequently subject to misperceptions. For example, a report prepared by politicians in 2005 described the UK scheme as ‘widely considered to be failing’, an assessment that no scientist experienced in the field would accept. One of the main reasons for this assessment seemed to be the problem of under‐reporting, but this is inherent in the method.

There seem to be some widely held myths about under‐reporting which can be questioned. The first is that the overall degree of under-reporting approximates to 90% (i.e. only 10% of ADRs are reported).
The evidence base for this is very limited and the reality is that the degree of under‐reporting varies considerably in relation to factors such as seriousness, the novelty of the drug and the nature of the suspected ADR. Critics also believe that the effectiveness of these schemes might be directly proportional to the number of reports received and that under‐reporting undermines the whole concept.
These perceptions are not based on hard evidence and do not reflect decades of experience with the method.
Despite the limitations discussed, it is clear that we will continue to need systems that fulfil the purpose of spontaneous ADR reporting schemes for the foreseeable future. It is also clear that, for most drugs, relying on spontaneous reporting alone is insufficient and a proactive approach to studying safety using pharmacoepidemiological studies is required.

## Pharmacoepidemiological Studies

Pharmacoepidemiology is the scientific discipline of studying drug effects in populations, which is largely focused on measuring potential harms and safety in the post‐marketing phase. Pharmacoepidemiological studies are observational (whereas clinical trials are experimental or interventional) – they attempt to measure effects under real‐life conditions. Larger populations can be studied than in clinical trials and the findings are likely to be generally applicable. However, as discussed in Chapter 2, without randomisation, attribution of causation is more difficult. Observational studies provide evidence of association (or no association) and a judgement then has to be made on causation taking into account all the available information. To recap from Chapter 2, four possible explanations for a positive association generally have to be considered:

1. Chance – taking into account the level of statistical significance 2) Bias – a systematic error
2. Confounding – the association is produced by a third factor which is related to both drug use and outcome
3. Causal effect – the other explanations can reasonably be excluded, as assessed by Bradford Hill’s criteria.

There are two principal types of study design:
Cohort study – all users of a medicinal product (the exposure) are identified and followed‐up to determine what events or ADRs occur (the outcomes).

- Case–control study – all cases of the disease (the outcome), the putative reactions are identified and their use of the drugs of interest (the exposures) are compared with controls without this disease.
- A case–control study may be nested within a cohort study (i.e. cases and controls are all drawn from a clearly defined cohort). This is an efficient design which is commonly used in pharmacoepidemiology.Attempts are made in the design and analysis of pharmacoepidemiology studies to minimise possible biases, and to identify and adjust for confounding factors.

Typically, a cohort study will measure both absolute and relative risks, whereas a case–control study will usually only measure odds ratios which generally approximate to relative risks.

Pharmacoepidemiological studies can be set up from scratch (‘field’ studies) but large studies are now almost invariably conducted by using data collected for other purposes, such as from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink in the UK or various health maintenance/insurance organisations in the USA.
In order to be useful for pharmacoepidemiological purposes, a database must provide:

- Prescription records
- Adverse event data
- Demographic and other health information.

Studies can be carried out solely using information on a database, particularly if the quality of the data has been validated. However, it is considered good practice to seek additional information from clinical records, particularly to confirm that there is adequate evidence to support diagnosis of the adverse event in individual cases. This can lead to some potential cases being excluded and exclusions may be specified for other reasons but, in general, these should be kept to a minimum in order to retain the advantage that such data have in representing real life.

## Prescription‐Event Monitoring

Prescription‐event monitoring (PEM) – sometimes known as cohort event monitoring – is a pharmacoepidemiological system which was developed in New Zealand in the late 1970s and in England around 1980. The method has also proved to be valuable in Japan. It is mostly focused on new medicines, particularly those used for chronic diseases, and is complementary to spontaneous reporting as a method of identifying unexpected ADRs. In New Zealand, the Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme (IMMP) identified many new signals during its years of operation (1977–2013).

PEM has the advantage that the number of users of the drug (i.e. the denominator population) is known and therefore that event frequencies can be quantified. An important point about the method is that all events are recorded (in the numerator), whether or not there is suspicion that they were drug‐induced. PEM can therefore identify effects that clinicians do not recognise as being ADRs. This type of study can be used to investigate potential safety issues that have been identified during development, for example to determine the frequency of a specific ADR in real‐life use or to investigate risk factors for ADRs.

A further use of PEM is to perform drug utilisation studies and these include investigation of safety issues, such as the reasons patients had for stopping a medicine.

In PEM, patients taking specific medicines are identified through prescriptions written by general practitioners (GPs) and dispensed by pharmacists. In UK PEM, undertaken by the Drug Safety Research Unit (DSRU), prescription records are obtained from a central database, whereas in New Zealand PEM, prescription records are sent directly from pharmacies to the IMMP. Both methods result in the formation of nationwide cohorts of patients and using dispensing records rather than prescription records (as is the case in general practice database studies) gives a more accurate estimate of the cohort using a medicine, because up to 25% of prescriptions are never dispensed. The usual size of the cohort in PEM is about 10000 patients – almost an order of magnitude greater than the usual number studied in clinical trials before marketing.

Adverse events that occur during the monitoring period are then captured on forms/questionnaires which are sent to and completed by the patient’s GP. Follow‐up questionnaires can also request other information about the patient, for example clinical details which help identify risk factors for adverse events. Over many years, both the UK DSRU and the New Zealand IMMP modified PEM to conduct numerous pharmacoepidemiology studies and examine specific clinical issues. For example, an IMMP study of atypical antipsychotic medicines showed that one in five adult patients taking clozapine developed nocturnal bed‐wetting.

PEM has been shown to be a useful and adaptable method to perform post‐marketing safety studies. Like spontaneous reporting, PEM schemes are voluntary and in both New Zealand and the UK they have received excellent cooperation from GPs, pharmacists, other health professionals and patients. When a medicine has been studied by PEM and no important new ADRs have been identified, the data provide some reassurance about its safety. However, PEM studies are usually not large enough to identify very rare ADRs and longer term ADRs can still arise after the period of monitoring. PEM continues in the UK, but in New Zealand the IMMP was closed in 2013 because of insufficient funding.

## Registries

A registry is used to collect individual patient data which can be used for epidemiological studies. Ideally, it will provide complete capture of a sub-population based on a disease, treatment, specific exposure or outcome.
Registries are particularly useful for studying long‐term effects, rare diseases and rare exposures. With regard to drug safety, some examples of registries are as follows.
Disease/outcome‐based registries:

- Cancer
- Orphan diseases
- Fetal/neonatal outcomes (from pregnancy registries or birth registers).
- Drug‐based registries:
- As part of a risk minimisation programme (e.g. clozapine monitoring schemes)
- Drugs used to treat orphan diseases
- Medicines taken in pregnancy.

A registry that has been used to collect data on biological therapies for rheumatoid arthritis is an example of one that is based on both disease and drugs. Registries that are disease‐based offer greater flexibility in terms of study design – patients not exposed to particular drugs are useful for comparative purposes.

## Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analysis

These are important tools in evidence‐based medicine and their underlying purpose is often to guide health and treatment policies, and determine the future research agenda.

A systematic review brings together and evaluates all the relevant research relating to a particular question. Usually, such reviews focus on identifying research papers published in the scientific literature, but authors of extensive systematic reviews can also approach researchers for unpublished evidence. A group known as the Cochrane Collaboration was formed for the purpose of appraising medical treatments. Its findings are published in the Cochrane Library which is widely available, freely in some countries. Most of the focus has been on evidence of efficacy from randomised trials, but many Cochrane reviews include information on safety outcomes and an adverse event methods group has also been formed.

A meta‐analysis brings together data from different studies in a quantitative way so as to provide a single overall estimate of a specified effect. When doing this, it is best to use only evidence of one particular type (e.g. from randomised trials) and the outcome(s) must be expressed in the same terms for all the studies. While meta‐analysis has most often been focused on efficacy, it can be used for adverse outcomes and the method is useful for contributing to drug safety issues and risk–benefit assessments. Meta‐analysis of data from observational studies is possible, but is more controversial than that from randomised controlled trials.

A meta‐analysis is, in effect, a study of studies and should be conducted according to a defined protocol. As far as possible, all the relevant evidence should be included, whether published or not, but duplication has to be avoided. In the presentation of data, the individual study findings ought to be demonstrated in addition to the overall effect. Meta‐analysis is not the same as simple pooling of data from several studies. Rather than merely pooling the numerators and denominators, a meta‐analysis combines the observed differences between treatments for each study and weighs them according to the precision of the studies, so that the larger studies carry more weight.

As well as providing a combined estimate, a meta‐analysis should aid understanding of the strengths and limitations of the available evidence. It is important to consider the reasons why the individual studies appear to differ in their findings. If there is a large degree of heterogeneity in the data, it is still possible to display that graphically but it may not be sensible to calculate a single overall estimate.

## Conclusions

This chapter has considered the main types of data that are used in pharmacovigilance, including preclinical studies, clinical trials, spontaneous ADR data, pharmacoepidemiological studies (including case–control, cohort and PEM studies), registries, systematic reviews and meta‐analysis. In summarising all these potential data sources, we have discussed their strengths and limitations. In the next chapter, we try to illustrate how such data fit into the overall process of pharmacovigilance.

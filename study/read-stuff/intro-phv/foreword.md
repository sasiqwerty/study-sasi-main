# Foreword

No effective medicine is without risk, and full understanding of a medicine’s safety profile is only achieved after wide clinical use.
The advent of new therapies which hold the promise of transforming disease outlook means that patients and healthcare professionals are unwilling to wait to access them. It also means that the uncertainties around the balance of benefits and risks at the time of first availability of a new medicine may be greater than ever.
With every therapeutic advance, the boundaries between categories of healthcare products – medicines, advanced therapies, diagnostic agents – become ever more blurred and the practice of medicine more personalised to the individual patient. The continuing need for the study of medicines safety in wider populations could perhaps be called into question.
In fact, the study of drug safety in clinical use has moved to centre stage in public health, precisely because of the recognition that although by and large adverse effects are rare, it is only by undertaking systematic large‐scale surveillance that we can detect serious problems early and take prompt action to minimise harms – as it were, to
‘fix it while you fly’.
Pharmaceuticals are used internationally and the need for effective drug safety monitoring is recognised worldwide. A signal of a safety issue associated with a new medicine introduced in a public health programme in a resource‐limited setting is just as relevant to a patient who may receive the same medicine in a high‐tech healthcare environment. The political landscape may shift, but pharmacovigilance knows no borders.
The detection and evaluation of adverse effects associated with medicines involves specialists from a range of scientific disciplines who are attracted by the challenges of adding new knowledge that supports safe use of medicines. But pharmacovigilance can only be effective if it is relevant to the daily lives and embedded in the professional practice of all those who use medicines – the prescriber, the patient and their carer. There is clear evidence that reports from patients provide invaluable information on the impact of an adverse effect on life and work, and are of an equivalent level of seriousness to those from healthcare professionals.
This all adds up to the value of a broad appreciation and an up‐to-date understanding of the principles and practice of pharmacovigilance. This new edition of a clear and succinct yet comprehensive guide to the field provides exactly the right introduction for those new to the challenges and the excitement of pharmacovigilance. It conveys the importance to public health protection of an effective safety net to pick up new information, and the need for well‐planned strategies to generate new evidence as an enabler of innovation.
Everyone who uses a medicine has a part to play in helping to fill the knowledge gaps on safety in as near to real‐time as possible. While pharmacovigilance has now moved on to more robust forms of evidence than reliance on individual case reports of adverse effects, the alert prescriber or patient who observes a possible link between a medicine they are using and an adverse effect is still the cornerstone of pharmacovigilance. The appreciation that each one of us has a role in drug safety means that this updated book is not only a welcome but an essential guide.

        <h1 id="the-process-of-pharmacovigilance">The Process of Pharmacovigilance</h1>
<h2 id="overview--a-risk-management-process">Overview – A Risk Management Process</h2>
<p>As indicated in Chapter 1, pharmacovigilance is essentially a risk management process for medicines. The process starts with identification of a possible hazard, which is then evaluated and investigated and, if necessary, some action is then taken with a view to minimising risks. Implementation requires tools for communicating with prescribers and users and the final step should be an assessment of the effectiveness of this process. The whole process of risk management is iterative because new evidence may emerge, or the measures taken may turn out to be insufficient. Rarely can a drug safety issue be considered completely and permanently resolved.
The start of the process is usually a ‘signal’ (something that needs to be looked at further), which may not turn out to be a true hazard.
Before that can happen, there is a need to identify the signal.</p>
<h2 id="signal-detection">Signal Detection</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-a-signal">What is a Signal?</h3>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a signal as: Reported information on a possible causal relationship between an adverse event and a drug, the relationship being unknown or incompletely documented previously. Usually more than a single report is required to generate a signal, depending upon the seriousness of the event and the quality of the information.</p>
<p>This definition seems mainly focused on spontaneous ADR reporting data. A broader approach would be to consider a signal as simply an alert from any available data source that a drug may be associated with a previously unrecognised hazard or that a known hazard may be quantitatively (e.g. more frequent) or qualitatively (e.g. more serious) different from existing knowledge. This approach is in line with the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) VIII report (see Chapter 6), which defines a signal as: Information that arises from one or multiple sources (including observations and experiments), which suggests a new potentially causal association, or a new aspect of a known association, between an intervention and an event or a set of related events, either adverse or beneficial, that is judged to be of sufficient likelihood to justify verificatory action.</p>
<p>In practice, most signals will relate to previously unrecognised hazards, but a striking example of a signal that a known hazard was more serious than previously thought occurred in the mid‐1990s. The non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drug, tiaprofenic acid, had been known to cause cystitis for over a decade, but a series of cases was then reported indicating that, if the reaction was not recognised and the drug was continued in the long term, severe chronic cystitis might occur. The outcome was that surgical resection of the bladder was often necessary, leading to permanent disability.</p>
<p>While some signals may be detected passively (e.g. from the medical literature), the process of signal detection should be fundamentally an active one. In terms of finding signals in large databases, it has been suggested that this is akin to looking for a needle in a haystack, although there are likely to be lots of needles to find. The term data mining (actively searching for patterns in large datasets) is now widely used in this context, particularly in relation to systematic detection of signals from large spontaneous ADR databases.</p>
<h3 id="processes-for-signal-detection">Processes for Signal Detection</h3>
<p>In the context of spontaneous ADR reporting, a signal is normally a series of cases of similar suspected ADRs reported in relation to a particular medicinal product. When the suspected ADR is a condition that is rare in the general population (e.g. aplastic anaemia, toxic epidermal necrolysis), a very small number of cases associated with a single drug is unlikely to be a chance phenomenon, even if the drug has been used quite widely. Except for certain types of event that are particularly important and likely to be drug related (e.g. anaphylaxis), a single case is not usually sufficient to raise a signal. Three cases are generally considered to be the minimum number of cases needed.</p>
<p>The amount of drug usage (i.e. some drug exposure data) is helpful in providing context to a series of reported cases, but it is not usually critical in determining whether there is a signal that needs to be evaluated. The strength of evidence for the individual cases will be important to consider later but, initially, the key issue is whether there is an unexpectedly large enough number of cases.</p>
<p>In the past, various methods have been used to detect signals using spontaneous reporting data. Calculating reporting rates based on usage denominator data, as prescriptions dispensed or defined daily doses (or less accurately from estimated sales figures), may enable a signal of a particular ADR to be derived by comparison with alternative treatments. As spontaneous ADR reporting schemes are subject to a variable and unknown degree of under‐reporting and denominator data derived from sales data can be very inaccurate, such comparisons are crude. They may also be biased, particularly if the drugs being compared have been marketed for different indications or durations, or if there has been significant publicity about the adverse effects of one of the drugs.</p>
<p>Disproportionality Approaches or Signal Detection The other principal approach that has been for making comparisons between drugs is to use the proportions of all ADRs for a particular drug that are of a specific type – perhaps within an organ system class of reactions (e.g. gastrointestinal or cutaneous). This is known as profiling, a method that has an advantage over reporting rates in that it is independent of the level of usage. The data can be displayed graphically as ‘ADR profiles’. This proportionate approach forms the basis of statistical methods which have been developed since the mid-1990s and are now widely used. One important advantage of these methods is that no external data (e.g. usage) are required – they are entirely based on information present on a single database.</p>
<p>The basic concept behind such measures of ‘disproportionality’ is whether more reports have been received for a particular drug– reaction combination than might have been expected as background noise. When all drugs are considered together, large ADR databases tend to have fairly stable proportions of particular reactions over time. That proportion is used as a baseline for comparison –to determine what would be expected if there was no signal. For example, in the UK Yellow Card database in the mid‐1990s, there were nearly 600 000 suspected reactions which had been reported to any drug over a period of 30 years. Almost 800 of these (about 0.13%) were classified as ‘uveitis’ (inflammation of the middle layer of the eye). A few years earlier, a new anti‐tuberculous drug,rifabutin, had been introduced and some 41 cases of uveitis were reported as suspected ADRs to this drug. In total, only 55 reactions of any kind had been reported with rifabutin by that time (i.e. 75% of them were uveitis). In this example, the expected proportion of uveitis reports (derived from placing all other drugs together) was 0.13% but the observed value for rifabutin was 75%. Dividing 75/0.13 yields a number well over 500 – this is known as the proportional reporting ratio (PRR). The ‘null value’ of a PRR is 1 and the calculation is made from a two‐by‐two table, as shown in Table 4.1.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the statistical tests, this was very unlikely to have occurred by chance and is a very extreme finding. In fact, this signal was quite obvious without using mathematics. The approach is more likely to be useful in identifying signals that might otherwise be missed when the PRR is much lower – say in the range of 1–10.
In general, experience has shown that a PRR of 3 or more represents a degree of disproportionality worth looking into further, providing it is unlikely to have occurred by chance, that is, the value of chi‐squared exceeds 4 (roughly the 5% level of statistical significance).</p>
<p><img src="file:////home/sasi/Documents/study-sasi-main/study/learn-stuff/phv/training/md%20files/training-guide/images/p70t4-1.png" alt="table 4.1"></p>
<p>Going back to the point about generally needing three cases, it is therefore possible to regard the following as cut‐off points for a minimum signal:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PRR &gt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chi‐squared &gt;4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>N = 3 or more.</p>
<p>Using such criteria, whole databases can be screened regularly by calculating two‐by‐two tables for all drug–reaction combinations to identify those that most need further attention.</p>
<p>A useful way of visualising the data is to plot, on logarithmic scales, the PRR against the value of chi‐squared using the number of reports ( N) as the symbol (Figure 4.1). The vertical and horizontal lines represent the cut‐off points and everything in the upper right‐hand quadrant is a signal of an unexpected degree of disproportionality.
Note that the 41 cases of uveitis reported with rifabutin appear in this quadrant as one of the most extreme data points.
Another useful way of looking at the data is to plot the PRR over time (Figure 4.2). In the historical example given in Figure 4.2, the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril was first marketed in 1982 but it took until 1986 before cough was recognised
Figure 4.2 Plot of PRR over time for captopril and cough (from UK spontaneous ADR reporting data); the number of reports is used as the symbol.
as an adverse reaction with this class of drug. Like thalidomide and practolol, the first indication of this association appeared in the published medical literature. By the beginning of 1986 there were at least 15 reports in the UK ADR database and the criteria discussed earlier would have been met some 2 years earlier when there were four reports and a PRR above 10. Note how the PRR fluctuates over time – ADR databases are dynamic – and that the increase in the period 1986–1988 is most likely to have been an effect of publicity about the reaction.
The PRR is just one of several measures of disproportionality that have been used. A reporting odds ratio (ROR) can be calculated from the same two‐by‐two table and has been mostly used in the Netherlands. The WHO Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) uses the information component (IC) and the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) the Multi‐Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS), both of which are more complex measures based on Bayesian statistics. These measures tend to produce less extreme values than PRRs when the number of cases is very small. However, when the sensitivity, specificity and predictive power of these measures were compared using Dutch data in 2002, no important differences were found provided at least three cases had been reported. In addition to PRRs, the UK regulatory authority now uses the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of points about these methods are worth emphasising.
First, although the numbers are calculated in a similar way to relative risks, they do not represent a meaningful calculation of risk. While it is true that the greater the degree of disproportionality, the more reason there is to look further, the only real utility of the numbers is to decide whether there are more cases than might reasonably have been expected.
Indicators of disproportionality are measures of association and even quite extreme results may not be causal. The next step is detailed clinical review of the relevant individual case reports and to assess any other relevant information which may be available. Many pharmacovigilance experts do not regard mathematical disproportionality alone as sufficient to raise a ‘signal’. Thus, use of the terms ‘statistical signal’ and ‘signal of disproportionate reporting’ has emerged.
Aside from such semantic considerations, the underlying nature of the data and various potential biases inherent in spontaneous ADR
reporting must not be forgotten. A specific problem arising from proportionate methods is that large effects may swamp and therefore mask smaller ones. For example, it is fairly obvious that PRRs calculated for all the other suspected reactions reported with rifabutin (the example given earlier) are going to be less than 1 but it is quite possible that some of these reactions would also be worth looking into further.
The data mining approach to signal detection has been questioned by some practitioners who believe that relying on clinical experience alone is preferable and that there are too many limitations to the disproportionality methods. It is generally agreed that detailed assessment of individual case reports (preferably by those with clinical experience) should be a key component of signal identification, but in databases where there are large numbers of ADRs, data mining may be seen as a useful first step to raise possible issues to examine further, or to add supporting evidence when assessing and investigating individual case reports. Hence, data mining should not be seen as a replacement for clinical assessment of reports, but rather an aid to it.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation-and-investigation">Evaluation and Investigation</h2>
<h3 id="signal-prioritisation">Signal Prioritisation</h3>
<p>Systematic use of data mining tools in a large spontaneous ADR database will identify large numbers of statistical signals. Evaluating all of them in detail would have major resource implications as many will
turn out not to be real or to require no action. Possible signals have often been evaluated or dismissed on the basis of subjective judgements, but two more formal methods of prioritisation have been developed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Triage (used by the WHO UMC) analogous to a process used in emergency medicine to decide on priorities. Essentially, it is a quick look at the most important features of a case series (e.g. seriousness, outcome) to decide on the urgency of further assessment relative to other cases.</li>
<li>Impact analysis (used by the UK MHRA) more quantitative and involves calculating two scores which are then used to decide an overall priority:
Evidence score:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Based on the degree of disproportionality (e.g. value of PRR)</li>
<li>Strength of evidence</li>
<li>Biological plausibility.
Public health score:</li>
<li>Based on number of reported cases per year</li>
<li>Expected health consequences</li>
<li>Reporting rate in relation to level of drug exposure.
The overall categories derived from these scores are as follows:</li>
<li>High priority – prompt further evaluation is required</li>
<li>Need to gather more information</li>
<li>Low priority</li>
<li>No action.
It is important to recognise that these scores are only a means of deciding whether further evaluation is currently warranted and that impact analysis can – and should be – repeated if more evidence emerges.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="principles-of-signal-evaluation">Principles of Signal Evaluation</h3>
<p>The data giving rise to the signal – whether arising from a series of individual cases or a formal study – should be evaluated in detail first. It is also important to consider what other immediately available data might be relevant, to obtain them and to include them in the evaluation.
For example, are there any other cases of the putative ADR (or similar clinical events) in randomised clinical trials, or are there any relevant</p>
<p>pre‐clinical findings? Are there any epidemiological data that might help, or is there anything of relevance in the published literature?
When evaluating a signal the key issues are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Causality – does the balance of evidence support cause and effect (see Chapter 2)?</li>
<li>Frequency – if this is a real effect, how often is it occurring? Can we make any estimate of the likely level of absolute risk (see Chapter 2)?</li>
<li>Seriousness of the ADR – are there any fatal cases, is the reaction potentially life‐threatening, can it result in long‐term disability?</li>
<li>Other clinical implications – even if the ADR is not serious (as defined here and in Chapter 2), are there other important effects for patients and healthcare systems (e.g. need for extensive investigations or inability to work)?</li>
<li>Preventability – are there any factors that, even at this stage, suggest a potential means to prevent the adverse reaction or serious outcomes arising from it?
In terms of frequency, the descriptors originally proposed by a CIOMS working group (see Chapter 6) are generally used, based on orders of magnitude and expressed as a simple proportion of patients affected (Table 4.2).
When evaluating signals from spontaneous reporting data, it is often difficult to obtain denominator or exposure data which are accurate enough to make a more precise estimate of expected ADR
frequency than suggested earlier. We have already mentioned that sales data have limitations and provide only a rough estimate of usage.
Table 4.2 Descriptors originally proposed by a Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) working group.
CIOMS descriptor
Frequency
Very common
More than 1 in 10
Common
1 in 10 to 1 in 100
Uncommon
1 in 100 to 1 in 1000
Rare
1 in 1000 to 1 in 10 000
Very rare
Less than 1 in 10 000
The most accurate way to estimate frequency of ADRs in post-marketing use is from more formal pharmacoepidemiology studies, for example PEM studies (see Chapter 3) where cohorts of patients are established from prescription records.
The outcome of signal evaluation is often that there is a need for further investigation, but there can also be enough evidence and concern to take action without waiting for confirmatory studies. If several deaths or serious ADRs had been reported and causality assessment suggested a ‘definite’ or ‘probable’ relationship with a specific medicine (see Chapter 2), it would not be ethical to wait for more formal studies to be designed, conducted and analysed. Also, in some cases, it may not be feasible to conduct further studies because no suitable resource is available with data on enough patients.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="further-investigation">Further Investigation</h3>
<p>Primarily, signals are further investigated to provide more information about the key issues in signal evaluation – to try to gain better evidence on whether the drug really does cause the effect, how common it is, how serious it is and how it might be prevented. In respect of the latter, this is often a question of trying to identify who is at particular risk of the adverse effect (i.e. what are the risk factors?; this is discussed further in Chapter 7). Thus, as discussed in Chapter 3, pharmacoepidemiological studies are the main way in which signals are further investigated.
Another common avenue of investigation is through mechanistic studies (i.e. through the application of basic science in the laboratory, can we understand the biological mechanism of the ADR?) Knowing, for example, that an adverse effect mostly occurs in people who are poor metabolisers of specific hepatic cytochrome substrates could be important in developing preventive measures.
Taking Action</p>
<h2 id="potential-options">Potential Options</h2>
<p>The ultimate purpose of pharmacovigilance is prevention and therefore the actions that are taken will generally be intended to help prevent occurrence of ADRs in the future. There are many factors that</p>
<p>can impact on the potential for prevention of ADRs. Broadly, these can be classified into characteristics of the user or the drug: 1) User characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demographics: age, sex, race</li>
<li>Genetic factors: polymorphisms (e.g. acetylator status)</li>
<li>Concomitant diseases (e.g. impaired hepatic or renal failure)</li>
<li>History of previous ADRs (e.g. allergy)</li>
<li>Compliance and use of other medicines. 2) Drug characteristics:</li>
<li>Route of administration</li>
<li>Formulation (e.g. sustained vs. immediate release, excipients)</li>
<li>Dosage regimen</li>
<li>Therapeutic index (a measure of the intrinsic safety of a drug in relation to dose)</li>
<li>Mechanisms of drug metabolism and route of excretion</li>
<li>Potential for drug interactions.
Based on these possibilities, a wide variety of potential actions can be considered and in various combinations. For taking regulatory action, it is useful to think of these in relation to the structure of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), sections 4.1–4.9, and the potential amendments that might be made (Table 4.3). Thus, it can be seen that every section of the clinical advice in the SPC might potentially need to be modified in relation to a new drug safety issue.
Apart from amending the advice to users, there are two more drastic types of regulatory action that might be considered. The first is to take some steps, beyond mere recommendation, to ensure that a key part of advice is implemented in practice. The second is to remove the drug from the market. A good example of the former is the scheme that was set up to ensure that users of the antipsychotic drug clozapine have their white blood cell counts effectively monitored (see Chapter 7). In essence, further supply of the drug was linked to the availability of a blood test result (i.e. no blood, no drug). The reason for this was that it had been demonstrated that regular blood tests would generally pick up a falling white blood cell count before patients developed serious infections and also that on stopping the drug, the process was reversible. A further example of a scheme that takes active steps to ensure that measures necessary to minimise risks are taken by users are the pregnancy prevention programmes set up for users of isotretinoin (a known teratogen).
Table 4.3 Potential for actions to improve safety related to sections of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC).
Section of SPC
Examples
Indications/uses
Limiting the indications to particular conditions with the greatest benefits by removal of indications: (a) for which the benefits are insufficient to justify use; (b) for which use is associated with a greater risk of the ADR
Dosing instructions
Reductions in dose (may be applied to specific groups, e.g. the elderly); limitations on duration or frequency of treatment (especially for ADRs related to cumulative dose); provision of information on safer administration Contraindications
Addition of concomitant diseases and/or medications for which the risks of use are expected to outweigh the benefits
Warnings/
Addition of concomitant diseases and/or medications precautions
for which the risks of use need to be weighed carefully against the benefits; additional or modified
recommendations for monitoring patients
Interactions
Addition of concomitant medications, alcohol or foods that may interact; advice on co‐prescription and any monitoring required
Pregnancy/lactation Addition of new information relating to effects on the fetus or neonate; revised advice about use in these circumstances based on accumulating experience or other new data
Effects on driving or Practical advice on possible impairment of coordination using machinery
or other effects due to ADRs such as sleepiness Undesirable effects
Addition of newly recognised ADRs; improving
information about the nature, frequency and severity of effects already listed
Overdosage
Adverse effects of overdosage; management, including the need for monitoring
In both these examples, the drugs appear to have particular benefits not shared by alternative treatments.
Over a period of many years, about 4% of drugs put on the market have had to be withdrawn for safety reasons – a fairly low proportion.
This reflects reluctance to use this measure unless it is clear that, relative to alternative treatments, the risks outweigh the benefits despite maximum attempts to minimise the risks (and maximise the benefits).</li>
</ul>
<p>Withdrawal from the market is particularly problematic for drugs that are used chronically by large numbers of patients. If the adverse effect tends to occur early in treatment, established users will have a relatively low risk of the ADR – the main need is to prevent new start-ers. Existing regulatory systems do not readily address this dilemma although in some instances it is possible for patients using a withdrawn medicine to continue it on a ‘compassionate use’ basis.
When considering such decisions in the face of uncertain data it may be necessary to take into account the impact of the precautionary principle. While, scientifically, it may seem unsatisfactory to act deci-sively on unconfirmed risks – the need being for more data – some decisions may have to be made in advance of definitive data, and the precautionary principle is well‐established in many areas of regulation. In particular, patients should not be expected to take a possible additional risk when there is no evidence of possible advantage in doing so. On the other hand, removing a drug from the market may mean that it becomes almost impossible to study it further and that clear answers will never be forthcoming.</p>
<h3 id="making-a-decision">Making a Decision</h3>
<p>The first step in making a decision about how to manage an important drug safety issue is to bring together all the relevant evidence into a single document. This is usually called a benefit–risk report and there is an internationally agreed structure which has been defined in a report published by the CIOMS IV working group (see Chapter 6).
Both companies and regulatory authorities use the report format and both usually use experts, often in the form of a committee, to review the report and help formulate the decision. Lay representation on regulatory committees has become increasingly common as such decisions are not purely technical and scientific, they involve value judgements and consideration of the impact of such decisions on patients’ lives. In most countries, regulatory decisions are overseen and sometimes directly made by politicians who are not necessarily bound by the scientific advice they receive.
The following is a suggested basic approach or framework for making decisions on drug safety (i.e. a structured list of the issues that should be taken into account):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is the nature of problem?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the evidence of benefit?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the evidence for risk? 4) How strongly would we wish to avoid the risks and obtain the benefits in terms of the nature of the potential harms and expected positive effects?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What assumptions have we made and how valid are they?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What areas of uncertainty remain and what evidence is missing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the options for action?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the expected consequences of each option?
Implementation
Unless the medicine is to be withdrawn from the market, most regulatory actions that could be taken will involve a change to the marketing authorisation and product information. Occasionally, the existing product information is considered satisfactory and the problem is merely that the recommendations within it are frequently not being followed. In these circumstances, ‘reminder’ communications may be issued, often directly by regulatory authorities and through regular bulletins by which the authorities communicate with health professionals. However, the extent to which these influence the behaviour of prescribers is unclear.
An important consideration is how quickly information needs to be made available to health professionals and patients. A new life-threatening ADR requires immediate communication, whereas the addition of a symptom that does not appear to be associated with serious consequences (e.g. nausea) to the undesirable effects section of the product information could be part of the next routine revision of the SPC. Most issues come between these two extremes and a judgement needs to be made about the speed of action and the most appropriate method of communication.
An issue that is particularly difficult relates to communication of signals to users of medicines. In the past, unconfirmed signals have rarely been communicated actively by regulatory bodies because of the uncertainty involved and because it is often difficult to make clear recommendations to users. However, in recent years expectations have changed and appearing to ‘sit’ on potentially worrying information which then leaks out can damage confidence in the system and lead to perceptions that the data are worse than is really the case. In an important example, in 2007 the WHO UMC published a signal of approximately 10‐fold disproportionate ADR reporting identified</p>
<p>from their spontaneous database related to statins and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (a life‐threatening neurological condition) despite much uncertainty about cause and effect. This was picked up and covered by the general media but, despite the very wide use of statins, it did not appear to create a major ‘scare’. Subsequently, the signal was effectively disproved by further investigation. It is likely that information about signals will increasingly be actively communicated in the future, for example through social media.
Other Methods of Implementing Changes in Practice Once a signal has been identified, it is primarily the responsibility of regulators to take action and implement changes in prescribing and use of medicines, using the methods described. However, this part of the pharmacovigilance process can also be supported and enhanced by other professional bodies, international organisations and also patient/
consumer groups to achieve effective results. An example relates to the contraceptive device Implanon. In the early 2000s, more than 200
unintended pregnancies following insertion of Implanon devices were reported to the Australian national regulatory body, the Therapeutic Goods Adminstration (TGA). This signal was investigated by the TGA in collaboration with an academic researcher and published as a case series in 2006. It transpired that many of the devices had not been correctly inserted and changes were subsequently made to the Implanon product information. In addition to the work carried out by the TGA to resolve this issue, professional bodies in Australia assisted the sponsor company with providing additional training to inserters of Implanon.
Following these actions, the numbers of unintended pregnancies with Implanon in Australia fell significantly</p>

<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
<h3 id="principles">Principles</h3>
<p>Communication is a vital stage in the pharmacovigilance process, but one that is hard to get right, particularly if there is an urgent need to act. The example of oral contraceptives and ‘pill scares’ discussed in Chapter 1 led to much more attention to this aspect and discussion of
the principles involved. Since the late 1990s, risk communication has developed as a sub‐specialist area of pharmacovigilance (with an increasing number of publications in academic journals) and it is now recognised that a particular set of skills is required to achieve effective communication.
The main requirements for a successful drug safety communication are that it is accurate, balanced, open, understandable and targeted.
These can be remembered by the mnemonic ABOUT (Table 4.4).</p>
<h3 id="practical-issues">Practical Issues</h3>
<p>The ABOUT criteria are considerations that can be used to formulate the process of developing a communication. A draft should be tested against these requirements by a review process which includes both individuals who are experts in the field and those who are generalists.
Communications intended for patients should be written in plain language and reviewed by lay people. Information should be prepared in the appropriate languages of the target populations in the countries affected. In urgent situations it is vital to spend enough of the time that is available ensuring that these requirements are met.
Table 4.4 Key requirements for a successful drug safety communication (ABOUT).
Requirement
Comments
Accurate
Are the facts and numbers correct? Is all the
information that the reader needs to know included?
Balanced
Have both risks and benefits been considered? Is the overall message right?
Open
Is the communication completely honest about the hazard without any attempt to hide or minimise it?
Have any conflicts of interest been declared and explained?
Understandable
Should be as straightforward as possible using lay language without jargon – the reader is more likely to respond appropriately if the message is simple and clear
Targeted
This involves considering who is the intended
audience and their specific information needs</p>
<p>It is particularly important in any communication about drug safety to ensure that essential information is clearly conveyed and not obscured by other less important information. The key facts and advice should be placed in a prominent early position (as many people will only read the first paragraph) with use of highlighting where needed. A clear lay‐out with sub‐headings, a large enough font, use of bolding/colour and inclusion of appropriate pictures or diagrams can make a huge difference to readability and effective communication.
It is vital that the level of the risk is made very clear by expressing it in absolute rather than relative terms (see Chapter 2). The need for clear and simple language is vital – a good tip when drafting is to read the communication out loud and listen to how it sounds.
Table 4.5 represents a basic model for any drug safety communication, whether it is to be targeted at health professionals or at a lay audience (e.g. the general media).
Information sent to health professionals should be clearly labelled
‘Important safety information’ and, if appropriate, ‘Urgent’. It is also useful to prepare answers to ‘Frequently asked questions’ as these are often placed on relevant websites.</p>
<h3 id="methods-of-communication">Methods of Communication</h3>
<p>Today there are many different ways in which drug safety messages can be conveyed to the target audience (which must be clearly defined), from hard copy letters through to electronic methods including social media and text messaging. It is important to consider which means will be most effective in the local environment and also which are the most appropriate. These aspects of risk communication are still evolving.

<h2 id="measuring-the-effectiveness-of-the-risk-minimisation-process">Measuring the Effectiveness of the Risk Minimisation Process</h2>
<pre><code>Measuring the success (or failure) of actions taken to minimise risk is an important step in the overall process, but one that is often over-looked or poorly done. Broadly, the possible methods of evaluating the effectiveness of actions taken are as follows:
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Testing the effectiveness of the communications – have they been received and understood (e.g. using market research techniques)?</li>
<li>Analysing the effect on prescribing – the extent to which prescribing habits may have been modified and whether these changes consistent with revised recommendations in the product information (e.g.
using longitudinal patient databases).</li>
<li>Monitoring spontaneously reported cases – to see whether serious cases continue to be reported. The numbers of cases reported may be difficult to interpret because of publicity bias, but it can be useful to see, for example, whether any of the reported cases reflect contraindicated use.</li>
<li>Observation/formal study of prescribing and events – has the action resulted in reduced morbidity/mortality from the ADR in practice?
This will require use of a longitudinal patient database, performance of clinical audits or an epidemiological study. A formal pharmacoepidemiological study is perhaps the ideal but has been the least frequently undertaken of these activities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="crisis-management">Crisis Management</h2>
<p>Every drug safety issue is different and an important step in dealing with one is to determine the level of urgency, using the principles discussed (broadly, the public health impact taking into account the absolute frequency of the hazard, number of users and seriousness).
Major, newly identified hazards result in a need to re‐evaluate the overall risk–benefit balance of a product. The highest level of urgency occurs when new evidence emerges suggesting that the risks of a medicine may outweigh the benefits, either for all users or in specific circumstances (e.g. a particular indication). Thus, a potential or defined need to withdraw a drug on safety grounds is inevitably a</p>
<p>crisis situation for all those involved in its management. In these circumstances, any delay can result in damage to patients and reasonable haste is necessary.
Crisis management in drug safety is not fundamentally different from dealing with other types of crisis. A standard operating procedure for crisis management needs to be in place beforehand defining:</p>
<ul>
<li>What will be considered a crisis</li>
<li>Composition of the crisis team and responsibilities</li>
<li>Stakeholders and need for interactions with them.
The first task of the crisis team is to draw up a specific crisis management plan which will define the following:</li>
<li>Key objectives</li>
<li>Expected timelines (likely to be days to a few weeks at most)</li>
<li>Resources required</li>
<li>Responsibilities.
The key tasks for the drug safety crisis team are likely to be the following:</li>
<li>Evaluation of the evidence</li>
<li>Decision‐making</li>
<li>Practical arrangements for implementation</li>
<li>Developing the external communication materials.
Progress towards the objectives needs to be reviewed daily and effective internal communication is vital. Because a regulatory authority or company (or other organisation) needs to deal with a crisis does not mean that routine work and other obligations can be ignored.
Therefore, personnel who continue to deal with routine work should ideally be kept entirely separate from the crisis team.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>This chapter has considered the process of pharmacovigilance from a signal of possible hazard through to remedial action, including effective risk communication. The outlined principles apply to pharmaceutical companies, regulatory authorities, researchers and other professionals involved in the practice of pharmacovigilance
worldwide, including those who can support implementation of changes in clinical practice in order to achieve safer use of medicines.
Good communication, both within organisations and with external stakeholders, is essential in achieving the best results from the process.
Chapter 5 considers how companies and regulators should interact to ensure that the pharmacovigilance process is appropriately applied.

The idea
A boat stuck in the stormy sea might never reach its destination.

The water flows down a stream, peaceful and quite. Its a sight to see. As more streams merge we get a river and its powerful, a sight to behold. We see a waterfall and all its eddies and currents. The water cuts deeper and shapes the banks and fuels the life around it. All it takes is a log falling in the wrong spot at the origin and we never even see the same river again.

The mind is like a river, there is no river if there is no flow. There is no mind if there is no thought. The brain below a certain threshold stops functioning normally.

The brain has to control a multitude of processes in the body, as we add more the energy is supplied accordingly.

We start facing problems when the body starts to get sedentary and the mind still has no choice but to maintain the same baseline as the energy supply can not decrease fast enough compared to the sharp decline in the motor activity, this is the first step to understanding depression and or the racing mind.
Physical activity increases the RBC count and that inturn increases the net total amount of oxygen for cellular respiration.

People who tend to eat a lot more than necessary start to see their natural motor function decrease to dangerous levels and this makes it impossible to perform other bodily functions, that tends to mess up the delicate balance of the system. Fats are only digested as a last resort ( the initial energy input is high for fat digestion) and with a the constant influx of food the body finds it quite hard to break down fat and just stores and just makes the process worse.

The racing mind problem arises with a lot of carbohydrate consumption and sedentary lifestyle. In this scenario the mind finds the glucose but the body cannot process the healthy fats (reason mentioned above) and gets tired quickly over longer mental bouts. The oxygen is used up faster and the water needed to cool the heated cells also gets warmer in the process and eventually fails to cool the system.

The human mind was never meant to process abstract thought but our body gave us the strength to do it and that in turn led to the civilisation's growth. The real reason was to process the nuances of speech and to understand and make informed decisions. The prefrontal cortex is for other purposes but we tend to use it to "think". The mind can only process abstraction in semi-isolation and cripples under its own weight in true isolation.

An involved conversation can be just as draining as an a abstract thought. A proper way to deal with abstraction is in a discourse it is the healthy manifestation of an intellectual thought process.

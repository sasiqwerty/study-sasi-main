### When we take a drink of water, the liquid can flow straight down the shorter, right-hand side of the stomach to end up at the entrance to the small intestine. Food, on the other hand, plops against the larger side of the stomach. Our digestive pouch cunningly separates the substances it still needs to work on to break them down, from the fluids that it can wave straight on through to the next digestive station. So our stomach is not simply lopsided; rather, it has two sides with different specializations. One side copes better with fluids, the other with solids. Two stomachs for the price of one, so to speak. The Meandering Small Intestine The small intestine meanders about in our abdominal cavity, twisting and turning for a distance of between 10 and 20 feet (3 and 6 meters). If we bounce on a trampoline, it bounces along with us. When the plane we’re sitting on takes off, it is pressed into the back of the seat like the rest of us. When we dance, it merrily wobbles along to the music, and when abdominal pain makes us wince, its muscles wince in a similar way. There are few people in the world who have seen their own small intestine. Even doctors usually examine only the large intestine when they perform a colonoscopy. But those who do get the rare opportunity of seeing their small intestine by swallowing a pill-sized camera are likely to be surprised. Most expect to encounter a gloomy tunnel, but what they see is a very different creature: moist, pink, with a velvety sheen and somehow delicate looking. Most people do not realize that only the final three feet or so (about the last meter) of our large intestine has anything to do with feces—the preceding sections of our intestinal tract are surprisingly clean (and largely smell-free, incidentally). Our gut faithfully and tastefully takes on everything we swallow down to it. At first sight, the small intestine seems rather more haphazard in its design than our other organs. The heart has its four chambers, the liver has its lobes, veins have valves, and the brain has specialized areas—but the small intestine just wanders aimlessly about in our abdomen. Its true design becomes clear at the microscopic level. We have here a creature that epitomizes the phrase “love of detail.” Intestinal villi, microvilli, and glycocalyxes. One

It also appears to have beneficial effects on inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and help in protecting against certain kinds of cancer. Of particular interest to those fighting fat is that olive oil also has the potential to help get rid of that spare tire. It blocks an enzyme in fatty tissue—known as fatty acid synthase—that likes to create fat out of spare carbohydrates. And we are not the only ones who benefit from the properties of olive oil—the good bacteria in our gut also appreciate a little pampering. Good-quality

### Many studies have been carried out into the effects of olive oil, and results show that it can protect against arteriosclerosis, cellular stress, Alzheimer’s, and eye diseases such as macular degeneration. It also appears to have beneficial effects on inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and help in protecting against certain kinds of cancer.

Free radicals do a lot of damage to our bodies because they don’t actually like being free, much preferring to bond with other substances. They can latch onto almost anything—blood vessels, facial skin, or nerve cells—causing inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis), aging of the skin, or nerve disease. That’s why you should always close the bottle or container of olive oil carefully after use and keep it in the fridge.

### Oils such as rapeseed (canola), linseed, or hempseed oil, on the other hand, contain more of the anti-inflammatory substance alpha-linolenic acid, while olive oil contains a substance with a similar effect called oleocanthal. These fats work in a similar way to ibuprofen or aspirin, but in much smaller doses. So, although they are no help if you have an acute headache, using these oils regularly can help those who suffer from inflammatory disease, regular headaches, or menstrual pain. Sometimes, pain levels can be reduced somewhat simply by taking care to eat more vegetable fat than animal fat.

### While our hunter-gatherer ancestors ate up to five hundred different local roots, herbs, and other plants in a year, a typical modern diet includes seventeen different agricultural plant crops at most. It is not surprising that our gut has a few problems with a dietary change of that scale. Digestive issues divide society into two groups: those who worry about their health and pay great attention to their nutrition, and those who get annoyed by the fact that they can no longer invite a group of friends round for a meal without having to go shopping at the pharmacy. Both groups are right. Many people err on the side of caution after hearing from their doctor about a food intolerance and then noticing that they do feel better if they avoid certain foods. They might decide to cut out fruit, wheat, or dairy products, and then often act as if they were poisonous. In fact, most people react to excessive amounts of these foodstuffs without being genetically intolerant to them. Most have enough enzymes to process a small portion of creamy sauce, the occasional pretzel, or a fruit pudding. However, this does not mean that real intolerances should be ignored. We do not need to swallow every new development in our food culture blindly. Wheat products for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, fructose in practically all processed foods, or milk products long after weaning—it is not surprising that our bodies sometimes rebel. Symptoms like regular stomachaches, repeated bouts of diarrhea, or severe fatigue do not occur for no reason, and nobody should be expected to just accept them as “one of those things.” Even if your doctor has ruled out celiac disease or hereditary fructose intolerance, nobody can deny you the right to avoid certain foods if you notice that doing so improves your general well-being. Apart from this general overconsumption, antibiotics, high stress levels, or gastrointestinal infections, for example, can also trigger temporary sensitivities to certain foods. When the body has returned to a healthy equilibrium, even a sensitive gut can usually sort itself out. Then there is no need to impose a lifelong ban on certain products, but simply to make sure you consume them in quantities your system can easily cope with. A FEW FACTS ABOUT FECES GENTLE READER, it is now time to get down to the nitty-gritty.

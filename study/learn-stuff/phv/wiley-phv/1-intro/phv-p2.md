## Serious Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Reaction

A serious adverse event (experience) or serious adverse reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:

- Results in death
- Is life-threatening
- Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
- Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
- Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should also usually be considered serious.

## Non-Serious

An event or reaction that is non-serious (does not meet any of the criteria for seriousness).

### Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR)

A noxious and unintended response to any dose of a drug or biologic product for which there is a reasonable possibility that the product caused the response. In this definition, the phrase “a reasonable possibility” means that the relationship cannot be ruled out.

The point here is the word suspected, which means some level of causality with the drug in question, is present. It may be serious or non-serious.

### Serious, Unexpected, Adverse Drug Reaction

An SADR that is serious and unexpected.

### Suspected Adverse Reaction

Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘‘reasonable possibility’’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.

### Suspected, Unexpected, Serious Adverse (Drug) Reaction (SUSAR)—EMA

An SADR suspected of being due to the drug in question (causality) and unexpected.

## Unexpected

Previously the idea was that an adverse event would be unexpected if it was possibly associated with or related to the use of the drug.

FDA has now changed this definition for clinical trial (IND) reporting to read as follows:

- For a pre-marketed product, An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.
- For marketed products, Any adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product. This includes events that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling, but differ from the event because of greater severity or specificity.

### Unexpected Adverse Reaction

An adverse reaction, the nature, severity or outcome of which is not consistent with the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC).

### Unlisted Adverse Reaction

An adverse reaction that is not specifically included as a suspected adverse effect in the Company Core Safety Information (CCSI). This includes an adverse reaction whose nature, severity, specificity or outcome is not consistent with the information in the CCSI. It also includes class-related reactions which are mentioned in the CCSI but which are not specifically described as occurring with this product.

## Expected

As opposed to “unexpected,” an event that is noted in the investigator brochure or labeling (Package Insert or SPC). The complication in the European Union (EU) is that two different reference documents (labels) are used for marketed drugs for expectedness. One is the global EU-level label (SPC) and the other is the company’s core safety labeling (CCSI). Usually, these are quite similar if not identical, but not always. An event or reaction may be found in one, the other, or both. If it is not found in the SPC, it is considered unlabeled. If it is not found in the core labeling of each member state, it is unlisted.

Thus, an event in the United States is expected or unexpected depending on whether it is found in the reference document: the investigator’s brochure for unapproved products and the approved labeling for marketed products. In the European Union, it is the same for unapproved products, but for marketed products an unexpected event or reaction may be unlabeled (not in the SPC) or unlisted (not in the CCSI).

## Simpler Definitions

Adverse events are unintended “bad things” that occur when taking a drug (or biologic or vaccine, etc.).

- They may or may not be due to the drug itself (the “active moiety,” or “active pharmacological ingredient” [API]), the formulation, excipients in the product like the inactive ingredients, fillers, the packaging, a contaminant, manufacturing problems, the underlying disease, or some other unknown cause or causes.
- Thus, an AE does not imply that the drug (the active component) caused the bad thing to occur.

An ADR or AR is an AE in which there is “reasonable possibility” of a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.

- Some interpret this to mean that the relationship cannot be ruled out. This is probably too extreme as it implies that unless causality can be absolutely, positively ruled out, it is “possibly related” or that there is a “reasonable possibility” of causality. Thus, an AE possibly or probably due to the drug is an ADR or AR.

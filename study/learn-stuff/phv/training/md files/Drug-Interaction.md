# Drug Interactions

## Mechanism of ADRs

The adverse effects of medicines usually mimic diseases or syndromes that occur naturally and have a variety of non-drug potential causes.

In broad terms ADRs can be categorised into 4 types.

- exaggerated therapeutic response at the target site
- desired pharmacological effect at another site
- additional/secondary pharmacological actions
- Triggering an immune response

ARDs may be explained by one of five mechanisms:

- 'on-target' adverse reactions
- 'off-target' adverse reactions
- cytotoxic reactions
- immune-mediated reactions
- idiosyncratic reactions, i.e., reactions of unknown mechanisms. A drug or drug class may produce toxic or adverse reactions by one or several of these mechanisms.

### On-Target Reactions

Drugs are intended to react with specific(intended) receptors in specific(intended) tissues. An 'on-target' ADR may occur when the drug interacts with its intended receptor in the intended tissue. Many drugs are expressed in more than one cell type. An 'on-target' reaction can also occur when the drug interacts with the intended receptor, but in an unintended tissue.

For example, intended targets for H1-histamine receptor antagonists are found in peripheral tissues, i.e., vascular smooth muscle, vascular endothelial cells, lungs, and nerve fibers. However, H1-histamine receptor antagonists with high lipid solubility cross the blood brain-barrier, interact with H1-receptors in the brain, and cause drowsiness.

### Off-target Reactions

Very few drugs are completely selective; Consequently they interact with different receptor types. An off-target ADR can occur when the drug interacts with an unintended receptor either in an intended or in an unintended tissue.

For example, a β2-adrenergic receptor agonist used to treat asthma may interact with β1-adrenergic receptors in the heart and increase heart rate; and β1-adrenergic receptor blocking agents targeting the heart may also antagonize β2-adrenergic receptors in lungs and cause broncho-constriction.

Two other examples of “off-target” ADRs, uncovered during post-marketing surveillance, resulted in the withdrawal of both drugs from the market. Terfenadine, an H1-histamine receptor blocking agent also interacted with unintended receptors (potassium channels) in an unintended tissue (heart) that caused fatal cardiac arrhythmias. The anorectic agent, fenfluramine, targeting 5-HT serotonin receptors in the brain also interacted with 5-HT2B receptors in the heart causing myofibroblast proliferation and fatal valvular damage.

### Cytotoxic Mechanisms of ADRs

Most drugs undergo metabolism into inactive metabolites in the liver and/or other tissues. Other drugs are produced, they must be metabolized into active metabolites to produce an effect; subsequently, they may undergo further metabolism into inactive metabolites. In some cases,however,the metabolites are unstable or reactive.

For example, therapeutic doses of acetaminophen (APAP) are metabolized by conjugation into APAP-glucuronide and APAP-sulfate; these compounds are nontoxic and are readily excreted. A small percentage of APAP undergoes oxidation by CYP450 isoenzyme 2E1 into N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), a highly reactive metabolite. This toxic metabolite must undergo conjugation by glutathione. The APAP-glutathione conjugate is nontoxic and is readily cleared from the body. However, with supratherapeutic dosages glutathione stores are depleted. As NAPQI accumulates, it attacks cellular and mitochondrial proteins in the liver.This, in a dose-dependent manner may lead to hepatic fibrosis or necrosis.

The main mechanisms responsible for fibrosis or necrosis include an oxidative pathway, which leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a reductive pathway, which leads to the formation of reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI). Moderate doses of a toxic drug or metabolite activate mechanisms that result in programmed cell death (apoptosis) and tissue fibrosis. High doses of a toxic drug or metabolite activate mechanisms that lead to uncontrolled cell death and tissue necrosis.

## Pharmacokinetic Drug Drug Interaction

The duration and intensity of drug action and ability to reach the intended and unintended receptors(in both the target and non-target tissues) is predicted by the level of the drug found in the blood plasma. In addition to dosage, the plasma level of a drug is modulated by the rate of absorption,distribution,metabolism and clearance.

These rates can be induced or inhibited by concomitant drug therapy.

### Absorption

- Drug A causes vasoconstriction at the site of administration and interferes with the systemic absorption of drug B administered at the same site
- Drug A delays gastric emptying and the systemic absorption of drug B absorbed primarily in the intestine
- Drug A neutralizes gastric acid (elevates gastric pH) and prevents the absorption of drug B
- Drug A forms chelates or complexes with drug B and prevents its absorption

### Distribution

Drug A competes for plasma protein binding with drug B and increases its plasma level
Drug A blocks the transport of drug B into hepatocytes and increases its plasma level
Drug A blocks the transport of drug B into the intestinal lumen and increases its plasma level

### Metabolism

Drug A induces a CYP450 isoenzyme responsible for the metabolism of drug B and decreases its plasma level
Drug A, inhibits a CYP450 isoenzyme responsible for the metabolism of drug B and increases its the plasma level
Drug A inhibits CYP450-independent oxidation and causes accumulation of toxic intermediary metabolites of drug B

### Renal Clearance

Drug A competes for renal tubular transport with drug B and increases its elimination half-life

### Biliary Clearance

Drug A increases the synthesis of biliary proteins involved in the conjugation of drug B and decreases its plasma level

## Pharmacodynamic Drug - Drug Interactions

To produce an effect in target and non-target tissues, a drug must form a complex with its intended and/or unintended receptor. The intended or unintended effect produced by a given plasma level of a drug may result from chronic use or a presence of one or more drugs that lead to

- changes in the number of available receptors or their ability to respond
- pharmacological interaction
- physiological interaction
- chemical drug interaction

### Receptor Alteration

- Drug A, when administered chronically, decreases the number of its own receptors or alters the adaptability of receptors to physiological events
- Drug A, when administered chronically, increase the number of its own receptors or alters the adaptability of receptors to physiological events

### Pharmacological

- Drug A (an antagonist) and drug B (an agonist) compete for the same receptor site and as a function of their respective concentrations either prevent (antagonist) or produce (agonist) an effect

### Physiological

- Drug A and drug B interact with different receptors and enhance each other’s action via different cellular mechanisms
- Drug A and drug B interact with different receptors and produce opposing effects via different cellular mechanisms

### Chemical

- Drug A interacts with drug B and prevents drug B from interacting with its intended receptor

## Drug-food Interactions

Nutrients can act as mechanical barriers and protect the gastric mucosa from irritants; but they can also prevent drug-access to mucosal surfaces and reduce or slow the absorption of some drugs. Other mechanisms such as chemical interactions or chelating reactions with food components can produce inactive complexes. Conversely, a meal with high fat content may actually increase the absorption of some lipid-soluble drugs.

## Drug-herbal Interactions

Components of grapefruit inhibit CYP450 isoenzyme 3A4 and increase the plasma level of a number of drugs; for example, it can significantly enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.6 Ginkgo biloba inhibits platelet function; its use with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs), and clopedigrel, which also interfere with platelet aggregation, increases the risk of bleeding.6

St. John’s wort induces the CYP 450 isoenzyme 3A4 and decreases the efficacy of many drugs, including some prescribed by oral healthcare providers, e.g., benzodiazepines and macrolides antibacterial agents.7 Large doses of vitamin C acidify the urine, inhibit the excretion of weak acids such as NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline and minocycline) and increase the plasma levels of these and other drugs.

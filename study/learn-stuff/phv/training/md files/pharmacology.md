Pharmacology is a branch of medicine, biology and pharmaceutical sciences concerned with drug or medication action,more specifically, it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function.

A drug may be defined as any artificial, natural, or endogenous molecule which exerts a biochemical or physiological effect on the cell, tissue, organ, or organism.

If substances have medicinal properties, they are considered pharmaceuticals.

The Pharmacological field encompasses

- Drug composition and properties
- Synthesis and drug design
- Molecular and cellular mechanisms
- Organ or systems mechanisms
- Signal transduction or cellular communication
- Molecular diagnostics, interactions, chemical biology therapy
- Medical applications and anti-pathogenic capabilities.

The two main areas of pharmacology are pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Pharmacodynamics studies the effects of a drug on biological systems, and pharmacokinetics studies the effects of biological systems on a drug.
In broad terms, pharmacodynamics discusses the chemicals with biological receptors, and pharmacokinetics discusses the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of chemicals from the biological systems.

Pharmacology is not synonymous with pharmacy and the two terms are frequently confused.
Pharmacology, a biomedical science, deals with the research, discovery, and characterization of chemicals which show biological effects and the elucidation of cellular and organismal function in relation to these chemicals.
In contrast, pharmacy, a health services profession, is concerned with the application of the principles learned from pharmacology in its clinical settings; whether it be in a dispensing or clinical care role.
In either field, the primary contrast between the two is their distinctions between direct-patient care, pharmacy practice, and the science-oriented research field, driven by pharmacology.

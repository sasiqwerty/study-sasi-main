## Anecdotal reporting

(eg, in journals) is simple; cheap and relies on individual vigilance and astuteness and might only detect relatively common effects.
Anecdotal Evidence - Evidence based on anecdotes arising from the analysis of individual clinical cases, rather than the study of scientifically randomized groups of patients. Such evidence may be true or false, but it is always unreliable because it is based on hearsay, faulty reasoning, or other cause.

## Voluntary organized reporting

Voluntary organized reporting (doctors, pharmacists,pharmaceutical companies) is simple but there is a chance of under-reporting and reporting bias by the “bandwagon” effect.

## Intensive event monitoring

Intensive event monitoring is easily organised but the selected population is studied for a short time.

Intensive monitoring (IM) is one of the methods of post-marketing active surveillance based upon event monitoring, which has received interest in the current medicines regulatory landscape. For a specific period of time, IM involves primary data collection and is actively focused on gathering longitudinal information, mainly safety, since the first day of drug use.

## Cohort studies

Cohort studies can be prospective and good at detecting effects but very large numbers required and tend to be very expensive.
Cohort studies are a type of longitudinal study—an approach that follows research participants over a period of time (often many years). Specifically, cohort studies recruit and follow participants who share a common characteristic, such as a particular occupation or demographic similarity. During the period of follow-up, some of the cohort will be exposed to a specific risk factor or characteristic; by measuring outcomes over a period of time, it is then possible to explore the impact of this variable (eg, identifying the link between smoking and lung cancer in the British Doctors Study.) Cohort studies are, therefore, of particular value in epidemiology, helping to build an understanding of what factors increase or decrease the likelihood of developing disease.

### Strengths and weaknesses of cohort studies

Cohort studies are an effective and robust method of establishing cause and effect. As they are usually large in size, researchers are able to draw confident conclusions regarding the link between risk factors and disease. In many cases, because participants are often free of disease at the commencement of the study, cohort studies are particularly useful at identifying the timelines over which certain behaviours can contribute to disease.

However, the nature of cohort studies can cause challenges. Collecting prospective data on thousands of participants over many years (and sometimes decades) is complex, time-consuming and expensive. Participants may drop out, increasing the risk of bias; equally, it is possible that the behaviour of participants may alter because they are aware that they are part of a study cohort. The analysis of data from these large-scale studies is also complex, with large numbers of confounding variables making it difficult to link cause and effect. Where cohort (or ‘cohort-like’) studies link to a specific intervention (as in the case of the Lansperger et al study into nursing practitioner-led critical care5), the lack of randomisation to different arms of the study makes the approach less robust than randomised controlled trials.

One way of making a cohort study less time-consuming is to carry it out retrospectively. This is a more pragmatic approach, as it can be completed more quickly using historical data. For example, Wray et al used a retrospective cohort study to identify factors that were associated with non-continuation of students on nursing programmes. By exploring characteristics in five previous cohorts of students, they were able to identify that factors such as being older and/or local were linked to higher levels of continuation.6

However, this retrospective approach increases the risk of bias in the sampling of the cohort, with greater likelihood of missing data. Retrospective cohort studies are also weakened by the fact that the data fields available are not designed with the study in mind—instead, the researcher simply has to make use of whatever data are available, which may hinder the quality of the study.

### Conclusion

Cohort studies are the cornerstone of epidemiological research, providing an understanding of risk factors for disease based on findings in thousands of participants over many years. Disease prevention guidelines used by nurses and other healthcare professionals across the globe are based on the evidence from high-profile studies, such as the British Doctors Study, the Framingham Heart Study and the Nurses’ Health Study. However, cohort studies offer opportunities outside epidemiology: in nursing research, the approach is useful in exploring areas such as factors that influence students’ progression through their programme or nurses’ progression through their career.

This approach to research does bring with it some important challenges—often related to their size, complexity and longevity. However, with careful planning and implementation, cohort studies can make valuable contributions to the development of evidence-based healthcare.

## Case-control studies

Case-control studies are excellent for validation and assessment but will not detect new effects and are relatively expensive.

A case-control study is designed to help determine if an exposure is associated with an outcome (i.e., disease or condition of interest). In theory, the case-control study can be described simply. First, identify the cases (a group known to have the outcome) and the controls (a group known to be free of the outcome). Then, look back in time to learn which subjects in each group had the exposure(s), comparing the frequency of the exposure in the case group to the control group.

By definition, a case-control study is always retrospective because it starts with an outcome then traces back to investigate exposures. When the subjects are enrolled in their respective groups, the outcome of each subject is already known by the investigator. This, and not the fact that the investigator usually makes use of previously collected data, is what makes case-control studies ‘retrospective’.

### Usefulness of Case-Control Studies

Case-control studies have specific advantages compared to other study designs. They are comparatively quick, inexpensive, and easy. They are particularly appropriate for

- investigating outbreaks
- studying rare diseases or outcomes.

An example

- An example would be a study of endophthalmitis following ocular surgery. When an outbreak is in progress, answers must be obtained quickly.
- Another example would be a study of risk factors for uveal melanoma, or corneal ulcers.

Since case-control studies start with people known to have the outcome (rather than starting with a population free of disease and waiting to see who develops it) it is possible to enroll a sufficient number of patients with a rare disease.
The practical value of producing rapid results or investigating rare outcomes may outweigh the limitations of case-control studies.
Because of their efficiency, they may also be ideal for preliminary investigation of a suspected risk factor for a common condition; conclusions may be used to justify a more costly and time-consuming longitudinal study later.

### Advantages of Case-Control Studies

- can obtain findings quickly
- can often be undertaken with minimal funding
- efficient for rare diseases
- can study multiple exposures
- generally requires few study subjects

### Disadvantages of Case-Control Studies

- cannot generate incidence data
- subject to bias
- difficult if record keeping is either inadequate or unreliable
- selection of controls can be difficult

## Case-cohort studies

Case-cohort studies are good for studying rare effects with high power but would involve large numbers,wont detect new effects and complex calculations adding to the already expensive process.

In a case-cohort study, cases are defined as those participants of the cohort who developed the disease of interest, but controls are identified before the cases develop.This means that controls are randomly chosen from all cohort participants regardless of whether they have the disease of interest or not, and that baseline data can be collected early in the study.

Case-cohort studies are very similar to nested case control studies. The main difference between a nested case-control study and a case-cohort study is the way in which controls are chosen. Generally, the main advantage of case-cohort design over nested case-control design is that the same control group can be used
for comparison with different case groups in a case cohort study. The main disadvantages of the case-cohort design is that it requires a more complicated statistical analysis and it can be less efficient than a nested case control study under some circumstances (e. g., in studies with long follow-up).

## Population Statistics

Population Statistics provide a common ground to study large numbers but are difficult to coordinate and the output might be poor and too coarse.

## Meta-analysis

[Article link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3049418/)

Meta-analysis uses already obtained data as its hard to obtain unpublished data and must take into account for the heterogeneity of different studies, it has its own disadvantages.

Meta-analysis is a quantitative, formal, epidemiological study design used to systematically assess previous research studies to derive conclusions about that body of research.

Outcomes from a meta-analysis may include a more precise estimate of the effect of treatment or risk factor for disease, or other outcomes, than any individual study contributing to the pooled analysis. The examination of variability or heterogeneity in study results is also a critical outcome.

The benefits of meta-analysis include a consolidated and quantitative review of a large, and often complex, sometimes apparently conflicting, body of literature. The specification of the outcome and hypotheses that are tested is critical to the conduct of meta-analyses, as is a sensitive literature search. A failure to identify the majority of existing studies can lead to erroneous conclusions; however, there are methods of examining data to identify the potential for studies to be missing; for example, by the use of funnel plots.

Rigorously conducted meta-analyses are useful tools in evidence-based medicine. The need to integrate findings from many studies ensures that meta-analytic research is desirable and the large body of research now generated makes the conduct of this research feasible.

### Introduction

Important medical questions are typically studied more than once, often by different research teams in different locations. In many instances, the results of these multiple small studies of an issue are diverse and conflicting, which makes the clinical decision-making difficult. The need to arrive at decisions affecting clinical practise fostered the momentum toward "evidence-based medicine. Evidence-based medicine may be defined as the systematic, quantitative, preferentially experimental approach to obtaining and using medical information.

Therefore, meta-analysis, a statistical procedure that integrates the results of several independent studies, plays a central role in evidence-based medicine. In fact, in the hierarchy of evidence , where clinical evidence is ranked according to the strength of the freedom from various biases that beset medical research, meta-analyses are in the top. In contrast, animal research, laboratory studies, case series and case reports have little clinical value as proof, hence being in the bottom.

Meta-analysis did not begin to appear regularly in the medical literature until the late 1970s but since then a plethora of meta-analyses have emerged and the growth is exponential over time. Moreover, it has been shown that meta-analyses are the most frequently cited form of clinical research. The merits and perils of the somewhat mysterious procedure of meta-analysis, however, continue to be debated in the medical community. The objectives of this paper are to introduce meta-analysis and to discuss the rationale for this type of research and other general considerations.

### Conclusion

The traditional basis of medical practice has been changed by the use of randomized, blinded, multicenter clinical trials and meta-analysis, leading to the widely used term "evidence-based medicine". Leaders in initiating this change have been the Cochrane Collaboration who have produced guidelines for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses and recently the PRISMA statement, a helpful resource to improve reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses has been released. Moreover, standards by which to conduct and report meta-analyses of observational studies have been published to improve the quality of reporting.

Meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials is not an infallible tool, however, and several examples exist of meta-analyses which were later contradicted by single large randomized controlled trials, and of meta-analyses addressing the same issue which have reached opposite conclusions. A recent example, was the controversy between a meta-analysis of studies and the subsequent publication of the large-scale trial (RECORD trial) that did not support the cardiovascular risk of rosiglitazone. However, the reason for this controversy was explained by the numerous methodological flaws found both in the meta-analysis and the large clinical trial.

No single study, whether meta-analytic or not, will provide the definitive understanding of responses to treatment, diagnostic tests, or risk factors influencing disease. Despite this limitation, meta-analytic approaches have demonstrable benefits in addressing the limitations of study size, can include diverse populations, provide the opportunity to evaluate new hypotheses, and are more valuable than any single study contributing to the analysis. The conduct of the studies is critical to the value of a meta-analysis and the methods used need to be as rigorous as any other study conducted.

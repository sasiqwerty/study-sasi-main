  - When and how to withdraw subjects from the trial/investigational product treatment.
  - The type and timing of the data to be collected for withdrawn subjects.
  - Whether and how subjects are to be replaced.
  - The follow-up for subjects withdrawn from investigational product treatment/trial treatment.

### Treatment of Subjects

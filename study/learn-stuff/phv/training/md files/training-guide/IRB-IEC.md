## Definition

The International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) defines an institutional review board (IRB) as a group formally designated to protect the rights, safety and well-being of humans involved in a clinical trial by reviewing all aspects of the trial and approving its startup. IRBs can also be called independent ethics committees (IECs).

- These are the bodies having the power to regulate.
- In the ICH GCP guideline the term includes the authorities that review submitted clinical data and those that conduct inspections.
- These bodies are sometimes referred to as competent authorities or Regulatory Agencies.

## Different Countries and their Regulatory Authorities

### United States - FDA Regulations - U.S. Food and Drug Administration

- The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA) is a federal agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. The FDA is responsible for protecting and promoting public health through the control and supervision of food safety, tobacco products, dietary supplements, prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical drugs (medications), vaccines, biopharmaceuticals, blood transfusions, medical devices, electromagnetic radiation emitting devices (ERED), cosmetics, animal foods & feed and veterinary products.

- The FDA's primary focus is enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C), but the agency also enforces other laws, notably Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, as well as associated regulations. Much of this regulatory-enforcement work is not directly related to food or drugs, but involves such things as regulating lasers, cellular phones, and condoms, as well as control of disease in contexts varying from household pets to human sperm donated for use in assisted reproduction.

- The FDA is led by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Commissioner reports to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

### Canada - TPD Regulations

The Therapeutic Products Directorate (TPD):

- reviews scientific information to assess the safety, efficacy, and quality of a prescription drug
- assesses the potential benefits and risks of a prescription drug
- reviews Clinical Trial Applications (CTAs) for prescription drugs to ensure that the studies are well-designed and that participants will not be exposed to undue risk
- monitors the evolving safety of drugs in development through the review of adverse reaction reports that are submitted as a requirement of the Food and Drug Regulations
- makes non-marketed drugs available to health professionals for patients when conventional therapies have failed, are not suitable, or are not available
- provides Canadians with science-based medical information they need to make informed choices

### European - Union EMA Regulations

The European regulatory system for medicines

_A consistent approach to medicines regulation across the European Union._

The European medicines regulatory system is based on a network of around 50 regulatory authorities from the 31 EA countries (28 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), the European Commission and EMA.
The diversity of experts involved in the regulation of medicines in the EU encourages the exchange of knowledge, ideas and best practice between scientists striving for the highest standards for medicines’ regulation.

By working closely together, Member States reduce duplication, share the workload and ensure the efficient and effective regulation of medicines across the EU.

To protect public health and ensure the availability of high quality, safe and effective medicines for European citizens, all medicines must be authorised before they can be placed on the market in the EU. The European system offers different routes for such an **authorisation**.

- The **centralised procedure** allows the marketing of a medicine on the basis of a single EU-wide assessment and marketing authorisation which is valid throughout the EU. Pharmaceutical companies submit a single authorisation application to EMA
- **the decentralised procedure** where companies can apply for the simultaneous authorisation of a medicine in more than one EU Member State if it has not yet been authorised in any EU country and does not fall within the scope of the centralised procedure;
- the **mutual-recognition procedure** where companies that have a medicine authorised in one EU Member States can apply for this authorisation to be recognised in other EU countries. This process allows Member States to rely on each other’s scientific assessments

A European Public Assessment Report,or EPAR, is published for every human or veterinary medicine that has been granted or refused a marketing authorisation following an assessment by EMA. For a medicine that is authorised by a Member State,details on the assessment of the medicine are also available in a Public Assessment Report.

#### The Role of European Commission

The European Commission plays an important role in the regulation of medicines in the EU. On the basis of scientific assessments carried out by EMA, it grants or refuses, changes or suspends marketing authorisations for medicines that have been submitted via the centralised procedure. It can also take EU-wide action when a safety issue has been identified for a nationally authorised product and when harmonised regulatory measures in all MSs are considered necessary following assessment by EMA’s PRAC. The European Commission can also take action concerning other aspects of medicine regulation:

- Right of initiative-it can propose new or amended legislation for the pharmaceutical sector;
- Implementation-it can adopt implementing measures as well as oversee the correct application of EU law on pharmaceuticals;
- Global outreach-it ensures appropriate collaboration with relevant international partners and promotes the EU regulatory system globally

#### The role of EMA

EMA is responsible for the scientific evaluation, primarily of innovative and high-technology medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU. EMA was established in 1995 to ensure the best use of scientific resources across Europe for the evaluation, supervision and pharmacovigilance of medicines.

Experts participate in the work of EMA as members of its scientific committees, working parties, scientific advisory groups and other ad hoc advisory groups, or as members of the national assessment teams that evaluate medicines. The experts are chosen on the basis of their scientific expertise and many of them are made available to EMA by the NCAs in Member States. Increasingly, patients and healthcare professionals are involved in the work of the Agency including in the evaluation of medicines.

#### EMA’s scientific committees

The EMA has seven scientific committees that carry out its scientific assessments:

- Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)
- Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC)
- Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CMVP)
- Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP)
- Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC)
- Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT)
- Paediatric Committee (PDCO)

#### National Competent Authorities

The national competent authorities (NCAs), responsible for the regulation of human and veterinary medicines in the EU, coordinate their work in a forum called Heads of Medicines Agencies (HMA). The heads of the NCAs work closely with EMA and the European Commission to maximise cooperation and ensure the European medicines regulatory network functions efficiently. The HMA meets four times per year to address key strategic issues for the network, such as the exchange of information, IT developments and sharing of best practices, and to streamline mutual recognition and decentralised procedures

#### Guidelines and scientific advice

EMA prepares scientific guidelines in cooperation with experts from its scientific committees and working groups. These guidelines reflect the latest thinking on developments in biomedical science. They are available to guide the development programmes of all medicine developers who wish to submit an application for a marketing authorisation in the EU, and to ensure that medicines are developed consistently and to the highest quality.

EMA also gives product-specific scientific advice to companies for the development of medicines. This is an important tool to help develop and make available high-quality, effective and safe medicines, for the benefit of patients. Scientific advice can also be given by NCAs.

#### Safety monitoring of medicines

The European regulatory system for medicines monitors the safety of all medicines that are available on the European market throughout their life span.

EMA has a committee dedicated to the safety of medicines for human use-the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, or PRAC. If there is a safety issue with a medicine that is authorised in more than one Member State, the same regulatory action is taken across the EU and patients and healthcare professionals in all Member States are provided with the same guidance.

All suspected side effects that are reported by patients and healthcare professionals must be entered into EudraVigilance, the EU web-based information system operated by EMA that collects, manages and analyses reports of suspected side effects of medicines. These data are continuously monitored by EMA and the Member States in order to identify any new safety information.

EMA provides public access to reports of suspected side effects for centrally-authorised medicines in the European database of suspected drug-reaction reports. This website allows users to view all suspected side effect reports submitted to EudraVigilance

The PRAC has a broad remit covering all aspects of pharmacovigilance. In addition to its role in risk assessment, the committee provides advice and recommendations to the European medicines regulatory network on risk management planning and benefit-risk assessment for medicines after marketing.

#### Clinical trials

The authorisation and oversight of a clinical trial is the responsibility of the Member State in which the trial is taking place. The European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT) tracks which clinical trials have been authorised in the EU. It is used by NCAs and clinical-trial sponsors to enter information protocols and results of clinical trials. A subset of this information is made publicly available by EMA via the EU clinical trials register.

#### International cooperation

The European Commission and EMA, in close cooperation with Member States, work to forge close ties with partner organisations around the world. These activities aim to foster the timely exchange of regulatory and scientific expertise and the development of best practices in the regulatory field across the world. The European Commission and EMA work with the World Health Organization (WHO) on a range of issues, including medicines intended for markets outside the EU (medicines reviewed under EMA’s so-called ‘Article 58 procedure’), the quality of medicines and the development of international non-proprietary names.

### India - Ministry of Health

The **Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation** (CDSCO) is India's national regulatory body for cosmetics , pharmaceuticals and medical devices. It serves a similar function to the European Medicines Agency of the European Union, the PMDA of Japan, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom, and the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China. The Indian government has announced its plan to bring all medical devices, including implants and contraceptives under a review of the Central Drugs and Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO).

Within the CDSCO, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) regulates pharmaceutical and medical devices and is positioning within the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The DCGI is advised by the Drug Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) and the Drug Consultative Committee (DCC). Divided into zonal offices, each one carries out pre-licensing and post-licensing inspections, post-market surveillance, and drug recalls (where necessary). Manufacturers who deal with the authority required to name an Authorized Indian Representative (AIR) to represent them in all dealings with the CDSCO in India.

#### Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI)

Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) is the head of department of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization of the Government of India responsible for approval of licences of specified categories of drugs such as blood and blood products, IV fluids, vaccines, and sera in India. Drugs Controller General of India, comes under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. DCGI also sets standards for manufacturing, sales, import, and distribution of drugs in India.

DCGI lays down the standard and quality of manufacturing, selling, import and distribution of drugs in India.

- Preparation and maintenance of national reference standard.
- To bring about the uniformity in the enforcement of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.
- Training of Drug Analysts deputed by State Drug Control Laboratories and other Institutions
- Analysis of Cosmetics received as survey samples from CDSCO (central drug standard control organisation)

With the notification of Medical Device Rules 2017 by the Government of India, DCGI will also act as Central Licensing Authority (CLA) for the medical devices which fall under the purview of these rules. Out of four Classes of medical devices from Class A to Class D, DCGI will be the direct licensing authority for Class C and Class D devices, whereas it will coordinate licensing for Class A and B devices through State drug controllers, who will act as State Licensing Authority or SLA.

The DCGI also has the responsibility of laying down regulatory measures and amendment of Acts and Rules, laying down standards for drugs, cosmetics, diagnostics and devices and updating the Indian Pharmacopoeia.

**T-License:**

A license given to export/import drug/ raw materials/ Ip from other countries. It is also called as shipping license.
There are two types of Drug approval process in the DCGI:

- Type A:
  it is also known as fast track process. The protocol is already approved in other regulation board. Duration of approval is 2-6 weeks.
- Type B:
  it is conducted only to single country concern. Duration of approval is 8-12 weeks.

#### Central Drugs Standard Control Organization has 8 divisions:

- **BA/BE**

  - Bioavailability (BA) : Bioavailability refers to the relative amount of drug from an administered dosage from which enters the systemic circulation and the rate at which the drug appears in the systemic circulation.

  - Bioequivalence (BE): Bioequivalence of a drug product is achieved if its extent and rate of absorption are not statistically significantly different from those of the reference product when administered at the same molar dose.

- **New Drugs**
  - Demonstration of safety and efficacy of the drug product for use in humans is essential before the drug product can be approved for import or manufacturing and marketing in the country.
- **Medical Device & Diagnostics**
- **DCC-DTAB**
  - This division deals with organizing and convening meetings of ‘Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) and Drugs Consultative Committee (DCC). The recommendations of DTAB and DCC on the matters rose out of administration of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Rules thereunder shall be done by amending the relevant particulars of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Rules thereunder.
- **Import & Registration**
- **Biologics**

  - Biological products, or biologics, are medical products. Many biologics are made from a variety of natural sources (human, animal or microorganism). Like drugs, some biologics are intended to treat diseases and medical conditions. Other biologics are used to prevent or diagnose diseases.

  - Examples of biological products include
    - vaccines
    - blood and blood products for transfusion and/or manufacturing into other products
    - allergenic extracts, which are used for both diagnosis and treatment (for example, allergy shots)
    - human cells and tissues used for transplantation (for example, tendons, ligaments and bone)
    - gene therapies
    - cellular therapies
    - tests to screen potential blood donors for infectious agents such as HIV

- **Cosmetics**
  - Cosmetic is defined as any article intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled or sprayed on, or introduced into, or otherwise applied to, the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness or altering the appearance, and includes any article intended for use as a component of cosmetic.
- **Clinical Trials**

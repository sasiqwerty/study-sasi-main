# Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

Official, detailed, written instructions for the management of clinical trials. SOPs ensure that all the functions and activities of a clinical trial are carried out in a consistent and efficient manner.

The ICH defines SOPs as ‘detailed written instructions to achieve uniformity of the performance of a specific function’.

An SOP is nothing more than a clearly written description of how particular task is to be performed.

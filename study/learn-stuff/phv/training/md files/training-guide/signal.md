# SIGNAL

Information that arises from one or multiple sources, which suggests a potentially causal association, or a new aspect of a known intervention and an event or set of related events either adverse or beneficial, that is judged to be sufficient likelihood to justify verificatory actions.

Traditional Pharmacovigilance Methods

- Individual case review
- Aggregate analysis
- Periodic reports

Traditionally, signals are detected through the assessment of individual case safety reports (ICSR) in an individual or cumulative manner. Usually more than 1 report is required to generate a signal and one generated are clinically assessed by PV experts at UMC.

There are 3 Types of Signals:

- confirmed signals - causal relationship between the drug and adverse event
- Refuted (false) signals - no causal relationship.
- Unconfirmed signals - require further investigation.

## Terminology

Reported information on a possible causal relationship which is being unknown or incompletely documented previously.

- Signal Detection : The act of looking for and / or identifying signals using event data from any source.
- Signal Evaluation : The formal process of reviewing scientific data sources to refute or confirm the existence of a signal in a company product safety profile; this confirmation will elevate the signal to a potential or identified Signal risk.
- Signal Prioritization : This as an important and controversial method of ensuring only those signals worthy of internal resources are passed into the formal evaluation process.

  - The WHO uses a method similar to Signal Emergency Room triage processes in hospital settings to quickly evaluate the Prioritization aspects of a case that make it critical for research while placing other cases on hold until a later investigation period.
  - The MHRA uses an analytic methodology comprised of two mathematical scores contributing to a final score that will prioritize the case.

## Process

To qualify as a signal through the current routine signal detection process. a drug-ADR combination has to go through and meet the criteria in the following procedure.

- The relative reporting rates for all drug ADR combinations reported in VigiBase are calculated. The IC value highlights the drug-ADR combination as being reported "unexpectedly". more frequently relative to the database background.
- For the highlighted drug-ADR combinations the triage algorithms (filtering methods) select combinations for which the ICSRs derive from at least own countries and meet one of the following criteria:
  - new drug and serious reaction
  - significantly increased IC value since the previous quarter
- Drug-ADR combinations filtered out by the triage algorithms are subsequently checked by UMC staff for occurrence in available product information and literature.
- The reaction is not found or not described well enough, the individual case reports are retrieved from VigiBase.
- A thorough clinical assessment of the individual case reports is then done either internally by UMC staff or externally by members of the UMC Signal Review Panel.

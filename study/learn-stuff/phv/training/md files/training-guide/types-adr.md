# Adverse Drug Reaction

We define an adverse drug reaction as “an appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction, resulting from an intervention related to the use of a medicinal product, which predicts hazard from future administration and warrants prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product.” Such reactions are currently reported by use of WHO’s Adverse Reaction Terminology, which will eventually become a subset of the International Classification of Diseases.

Adverse drug reactions are classified into six types (with mnemonics):

- dose-related (Augmented),
- non-dose-related (Bizarre),
- dose-related and time-related (Chronic),
- time-related (Delayed),
- withdrawal (End of use),
- failure of therapy (Failure).

Timing, the pattern of illness, the results of investigations, and rechallenge can help attribute causality to a suspected adverse drug reaction. Management includes withdrawal of the drug if possible and specific treatment of its effects. Suspected adverse drug reactions should be reported. Surveillance methods can detect reactions and prove associations.

## Types of Adverse Reactions

### Based on Avoidability

- Definitely avoidable : The ADR was due to a drug treatment procedure inconsistent with present day knowledge of good medical practice.
- Possibly avoidable : The ADR could have been avoided by an effort exceeding the obligatory demands of present day knowledge of good medical practice
- Unavoidable : The ADR could not have been avoided by any reasonable means.

### Classification of Adverse Events based on its severity

- Mild: No changes in the therapy are needed
- Moderate: Change of therapy is desired but the events are not life – threatening or causing disability
- Serious : is either life-threatening, fatal, Cause persistent disability, cause of prolong hospital admission
- Lethal : An ADR directly or indirectly contributes to a patients death

### ABCDEF Classification

#### A: dose-related (Augmented)

- Common
- Related to a pharmacological action of the drug
- Predictable
- Low mortality

#### B: Non-dose-related (Bizarre)

- Uncommon
- Not related to a pharmacological action of the drug
- Unpredictable
- High mortality

#### C: Dose-related and time-related (Chronic)

- Uncommon
- Related to the cumulative dose

#### D: Time-related (Delayed)

- Uncommon
- Usually dose-related
- Occurs or becomes apparent some time after the use of the drug

#### E: Withdrawal (End of use)

- Uncommon
- Occurs soon after withdrawal of the drug

#### F: Unexpected failure of therapy (Failure)

- Common
- Dose-related
- Often caused by drug interactions

## Important Definitions

### Unexpected adverse reaction

- An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with domestic labelling or market authorisation, or expected from characteristics of the drug

### Serious adverse effect

- Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, requires hospital admission or prolongation of existing hospital stay, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is life threatening
- Cancers and congenital anomalies or birth defects should be regarded as serious
- Medical events that would be regarded as serious if they had not responded to acute treatment should also be considered serious
- The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a medical event, as in the grading “mild”, “moderate”, and “severe”; thus a severe skin reaction need not be serious

### Adverse event/adverse experience

- Any untoward occurrence that may present during treatment with a pharmaceutical product but which does not necessarily have a causal relation to the treatment

### Signal

- Reported information on a possible causal relation between an adverse event and a drug, the relation being previously unknown or incompletely documented
- Usually more than a single report is required to generate a signal, depending on the seriousness of the event and the quality of the information

### Certain

- A clinical event, including a laboratory test abnormality, that occurs in a plausible time relation to drug administration, and which cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals
- The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible
- The event must be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary

### Probable/likely

- A clinical event, including a laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time relation to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge)
- Rechallenge information is not required to fulfil this definition

### Possible

- A clinical event, including a laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time relation to administration of the drug, but which could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals
- Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear

### Unlikely

- A clinical event, including a laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relation to administration of the drug, which makes a causal relation improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations

### Conditional/unclassified

- A clinical event, including a laboratory test abnormality, reported as an adverse reaction, about which more data are essential for a proper assessment or the additional data are being examined

### Unassessable/unclassifiable

- A report suggesting an adverse reaction that cannot be judged, because information is insufficient or contradictory and cannot be supplemented or verified

## Diagnosis and attribution of causality

The diagnosis of an adverse drug reaction is part of the broader diagnosis in a patient. If a patient is taking medicines, the differential diagnosis should include the possibility of an adverse drug reaction. The first problem is to find out whether a patient is taking a medicinal product, including: over-the-counter formulations; products that may not be thought of as medicines (such as herbal or traditional remedies, recreational drugs, or drugs of abuse); and long-term treatments that the patient may forget (such as oral contraceptives). The next step is to find out whether the effect could be due to a medicine. If the patient is taking several medicines, the problem is to distinguish which, if any, is causative. This problem is complex, because some of the patient’s complaints might be due to other diseases or to one or more of the drugs. There are many formal methods for assigning probability of causation to a suspected adverse drug reaction.

### Timing

The time relation between the use of the drug and the occurrence of the reaction should be assessed. Are they plausibly linked? For example:

- Does the reaction occur or get worse as the dose of the drug reaches steady state or when the steady-state dose is increased (for dose-related reactions)?
- Does the reaction abate or disappear as the dose of the drug is reduced or the drug is withdrawn (for dose- related reactions)?
- If a drug interaction is suspected, does the timing of introduction or withdrawal of the interacting drug fit?
- If there are features of an allergic reaction, has the patient previously been exposed? Lack of previous exposure does not rule out an allergic reaction, but previous exposure is consistent with such a reaction.
- If the effect is a congenital abnormality, did drug exposure occur at the appropriate gestational time?
- If the effect is a tumour, was the time lag sufficiently long for the tumour to have grown? The answer to this will depend on a knowledge of tumour kinetics.

## Pattern recognition

The pattern of the adverse effect may fit the known pharmacology or allergy pattern of one of the suspected medicines, or of chemically related or pharmacologically related compounds. Some patterns are pathognomonic or nearly so; for example, in a patient taking digoxin, a combination of heart block and an ectopic arrhythmia will almost certainly be due to the drug. However, this information should not be used to rule out an association, particularly with a new medicine, since an adverse drug reaction may not be known, or even predictable, from the pharmacology. For instance, corticosteroids, commonly used to suppress immune responses, can cause allergic reactions. Next, one should consider the background frequency of the event and how often it is associated with drugs. Headache is relatively common, so its association with a medicine may be by chance. In contrast, aplastic anaemia has a low background incidence and is often associated with medicines; it is therefore more likely to be an adverse drug reaction.

## Management

Rapid action is sometimes important because of the serious nature of a suspected adverse drug reaction, for example anaphylactic shock. Emergency treatment and withdrawal of all medicines is occasionally essential, in which case cautious reintroduction of essential medicines should be considered. Otherwise, using clinical benefit-risk judgment, together with help from investigations, one decides which medicine or medicines should be withdrawn as a trial. A problem immediately arises if one or more of the medicines is essential to the patient. If the culprit is fairly clear, a benefit-risk decision needs to be taken about the need for the drug (are there equally effective substitutes that are unlikely to produce the same adverse drug reaction?), the severity of the reaction, and its potential for treatment. If several medicines could be causative, the non-essential medicines should be withdrawn first, preferably one at a time, depending on the severity of the reaction. If the reaction is likely to be dose- related, dose reduction should be considered. Many prescribers unnecessarily withhold a drug when inter- actions are suspected, rather than adjusting the dose.

The patient should be observed during withdrawal. The waiting period will vary, depending on the rate of elimination of the drug from the body and the type of pathology. For example, urticaria usually disappears quickly when the drug is eliminated, whereas fixed psoriatic skin reactions can take weeks to resolve. If the patient is clearly getting better, in keeping with the prediction, alternative medicines for the basic disease can be introduced if necessary. If the patient is not doing well after withdrawal of the first drug, the next most likely culprit should be considered, and the process repeated. On the other hand, the patient may be suffering through being deprived of the medicine withheld. In that case, either another suitable drug should be substituted (remembering the possibility of cross-sensitivity), or the same drug should be tried at a lower dosage (for a dose-related reaction). The latter approach should be tried if more than one drug was withheld, for instance if an interaction was suspected or if the seriousness of the reaction made it wise to withhold several possible drugs. Reintroduce apparently essential medicines one at a time, starting with the one least likely to be the culprit.

If the patient cannot manage without a medicine that has caused an adverse reaction, provide symptomatic relief while continuing the essential treatment. For example, severe nausea and vomiting are routinely treated symptomatically in patients receiving anti-cancer drugs. However, when treating an adverse drug reaction, it is important not to introduce more medicines than are essential. Always have a clear therapeutic objective in mind, do not treat for longer than is necessary, and review the patient regularly and look for ways to simplify management.

## Surveillance

Outside of formal surveillance systems, all health-care professionals have a responsibility to inform their colleagues about clinically important adverse drug reactions that they detect, even if a well-recognised or causal link is uncertain. Information on what has happened and how the diagnosis has been made should be forwarded to a national centre with responsibility for giving general information about drugs and for taking regulatory action. National centres send this information to the WHO worldwide database. This global information is analysed by the WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring (the Uppsala Monitoring Centre), now with artificial intelligence in the form of a Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network, which allows the analysis of all the variables in a report against the background information contained in the WHO database of over 2 million reports. This work supports the review of information in all member national centres around the world (currently 59) and an international expert review panel.

- Anecdotal reporting (eg, in journals) is simple; cheap and relies on individual vigilance and astuteness and might only detect relatively common effects.
- Voluntary organized reporting (doctors, pharmacists,pharmaceutical companies) is simple but there is a chance of under-reporting and reporting bias by the “bandwagon” effect.
- Intensive event monitoring is easily organised but the selected population is studied for a short time.
- Cohort studies can be prospective and good at detecting effects but very large numbers required and tend to be very expensive.
- Case-control studies are excellent for validation and assessment but will not detect new effects and are relatively expensive.
- Case-cohort studies are good for studying rare effects with high power but would involve large numbers,wont detect new effects and complex calculations adding to the already expensive process.
- Population Statistics provide a common ground to study large numbers but are difficult to coordinate and the output might be poor and too coarse.
- Meta-analysis uses already obtained data as its hard to obtain unpublished data and must take into account for the heterogeneity of different studies, it has its own disadvantages.

## Future developments

The work of the WHO monitoring programme in Uppsala is described in detail elsewhere. The programme also supports the European Pharmacovigilance Research Group, which has allowed regulators and drug-safety specialists from a variety of European countries to come together to plan coordinated drug-safety exercises. Initiatives like these may pave the way for much more logical development and investigation of drug safety signals worldwide. Among the developments planned for the WHO programme are:

- An extension of the method of Bayesian artificial neural networks for the analysis of large amounts of data, in the hope of detecting hitherto unrevealed risk factors for the development of drug-related ailments
- Improvements in the classification systems of traditional herbal remedies
- Methods for improving communications in pharmacovigilance, as set out in the Erice declaration
- Cooperation with organisations interested in developing early signals of significance, including the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology, which is specifically interested in the science of pharmacovigilance, and the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences, which is pivotal in bringing interested parties together to mount various collaborative projects.

Clinical pharmacology has a very exciting future, because of possibilities of interfering with disease processes at ever more basic and specific levels. Knowledge of the human genome will allow us to predict susceptibility to an increasing number of diseases, and drug-induced disease will also be better understood as we gain knowledge of genetic influences on drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: we already use phenotyping and genotyping to predict some drug problems related to drug metabolism. Further genomic developments will allow us to develop predictive tests for the actions of drugs, including adverse drug reactions, holding out the possibility of more accurate tailoring of therapy to the individual.

As we accumulate more and more information on drug responses, we must not lose sight of the sobering fact that about half the cases of drug-related injury are from potentially avoidable adverse drug reactions.

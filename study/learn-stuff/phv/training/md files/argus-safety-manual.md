# Argus Safety Introduction

Argus Safety assists manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and devices by providing a simple and efficient way to comply with international and domestic regulatory safety reporting requirements.

- Why do we need regulatory safety reporting requirements ?
  - Having a common reporting scheme helps the authorities collect data and analyse it to draw conclusions. Argus safety does just that by ensuring the process is easy and standardised.

It also facilitates internal company safety surveillance by providing tools for signal detection and for analyzing the overall safety profile of both investigational compounds and marketed products.

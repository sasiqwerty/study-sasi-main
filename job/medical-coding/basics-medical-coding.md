Medical coding is the transformation of healthcare diagnosis, procedures, medical services and equipment into universal medical alphanumeric codes.

- the process of translating important medical information into codes for the purpose of documentation and proper retrieval at a later date.
- its hard to understand information if there different meanings to the same problem, this is a way to make sure that the medical problems are not misrepresented
- there is a central acting body that decides the right code for the problem and ensures that everyone follows the rules.
- the data is now easier to tabulate and is better used in research.
- the process is important for scaling and R&D.
- medical coding is also called clinical coding

- the basic task of a medical coder is to classify medical and health care concepts using a standardized classification
- clinical coding has three parts and they are

  - abstraction
  - assignment
  - review

- the abstraction process involves reading the entire record and analyzing the information to determine the code needed for the condition and the cause and its treatment.
- the next step is assignment and it has two parts. its finding the right right code for hte problem and then entering it to the system
- the third and final step is the review of the code assigned and its like a sanity check.

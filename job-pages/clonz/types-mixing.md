# Mixing in bioprocesses

Despite the advantages of pre-sterile, single-use technologies, mixing is one of their most complex applications. Industry has been progressing toward using single-use bag technologies rather than traditional methods of stainless steel tanks and grades A/B processing because of the positive aspects they impart to end users, including a reduced potential for contaminants, cleaning, sterilization, and capital. These technologies offer simplicity and flexibility. However, using them for an operation such as mixing can add processing challenges. For example, solutions in soft-walled bags do not always behave according to typical fluid dynamics as they would in rigid, cylindrical vessels.

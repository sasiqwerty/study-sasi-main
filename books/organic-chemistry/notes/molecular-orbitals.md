# molecular orbitals

- atomic orbitals are wave-functions and they can either combine constructively or destructively.
- the atomic orbital that combines constructively with another (AO) is called a bonding molecular orbital while the destructive combination is called the anti-bonding molecular orbital.
- The electrons in the bonding MO are closer to the nucleus and thus form a bond while the electrons in anti-bonding molecular orbital (out of phase orbital) are not able to bond with the nucleus, this exposes the nucleus of the atom to the nearby atom, this process discourages bonding with the other atom.
- the electrons if placed in the anti-bonding molecular orbital (ABMO) tend to destabilize the molecule and cause it to dissociate back into atoms.

# Spontaneous Post-marketing Adverse Events

SAEs play a huge role in determining the safety information when a wider population is exposed to the product of interest.

Clinical tests provide safety information in a narrow range and most of the results are sourced from a small group of volunteers.

- Smaller test groups ensue Inaccurate data
- Inadequate research regarding polypharmacy and drug interactions (unpredictable use cases)
- Narrow age group, ethnicity, body type

The safety data is obtained across multiple platforms and processed. The problem lies in the standardisation and normalisation of data.

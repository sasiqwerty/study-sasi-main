# SIGNAL

## TERMINOLOGY

SIGNAL-reported information on a possible causal relationship which is being unknown or incompletely documented previously.

- Usually more than 1 report is required to generate a signal
- before signals are published they are first clinically assessed by PV experts at UMC(Uppsala monitoring Centre ,Sweden)

To qualify as a signal through the current routine signal detection process. a drug-ADR combination has to go through and meet the criteria in the following procedure.

- The relative reporting rates for all drug ADR combinations reported in VigiBase are calculated. The IC value highlights the drug-ADR combination as being reported "unexpectedly". more frequently relative to the database background.
- For the highlighted drug-ADR combinations the triage algorithms (filtering methods) select combinations for which the ICSRs derive from at least own countries and meet one of the following criteria:
  - new drug and serious reaction (drug first entered into the database in the last five years and 51/11 is a WHO-ART critical term) [Glossary of terms]
  - significantly increased IC value since the previous quarter
- Drug-ADR combinations filtered out by the triage algorithms are subsequently checked by UMC staff for occurrence in available product information and literature. II the reaction is not found or not described well enough, the individual case reports are retrieved from VigiBase.
- A thorough clinical assessment of the individual case reports is then done either internally by UMC staff or externally by members of the UMC Signal Review Panel,

There are 3 Types of Signals:

- confirmed signals - causal relationship between the drug and adverse event
- Refuted(false) signals - no causal relationship.
- Unconfirmed signals - require further investigation.

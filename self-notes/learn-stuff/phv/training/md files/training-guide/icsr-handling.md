# Workflow â€“ How an Individual Case Safety Report is handled

There are many ways to handle cases. In some companies, there is ownership by an individual drug safety specialist, who is responsible for the completion of the case from the start to finish, making sure that any other personnel involved in the case handle the case and return it to the specialist who owns the case.
Other companies have less individual ownership of a case and instead move a case from task to task in the workflow, with a separate pool of workers for each step.

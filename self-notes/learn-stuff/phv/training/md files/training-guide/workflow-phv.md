# Workflow

The Adverse event is received and the document is indexed, the source documents filed. The case is checked for duplicates and assigned a priority level, other patient data is entered into the the system and preliminary quality checks are conducted.
The event is assessed and a company narrative is prepared for review and the case is assessed from a medical perspective. The case is reviewed for reportability and processed. If follow up is required the necessary protocols are followed and the case is updated accordingly.
A Risk/Benefit analysis is conducted based on the data, and the regulatory agencies and the analysis reports are prepared.
The report is forwarded to the regulatory agencies and the report is tracked thereafter.

## A Valid Adverse Event Report

The minimum requirements for a valid case.

- An identifiable patient
- An identifiable suspected company product
- An identifiable reporter
- An adverse event

## Individual Case Data Flow

The information is received from the reporters and the case is entered initially into the database. Later the case is cross-checked for duplicates and cleared to enter into the system as a new or a follow up case and registered. The next step in the process is triage where the case is judged based on its seriousness. The data is entered in the next step and the narrative is written and sent over to get reviewed by medical professionals. The case is closed after expert review and cleared to proceed for reporting.

### Basic Steps in the Case Handling Process

- Case Management Workflow
- Case Receipt
- Triaging
- Case Processing
- Medical review
- Follow up of adverse events
- Case completion

### AE Case Reception:

-AEs received from variety of sources via wide range of methods (Telephone calls, Fax, Mail, Electronic Media). The following information is captured:

#### Case details

- Case number
- Initial report or follow up report
- Companies the drug belong to
- Seriousness about the case
- Date of receipt by the company becomes the Regulatory Clock start date

#### Drug Details

- The reporter suspects that one of the drug is the cause. It is called Suspect Drug.
- The other associated drugs are called Concomitant Drugs. Along with the name of the drugs, dose, frequency, regimen, indication are recorded where ever possible.

#### Patient Details

Patient's age, country, ethnicity, medical history, etc.

#### Case Reporter Details

- About the person who reported the case.
- When the case is reported when the drug is in clinical trial, it is Clinical Trial Reporting.
- When the case is reported when the drug is in market, it is Spontaneous Reporting.
- When the case is reported through publication, it is Literature Reporting.
- The reporters of cases are categorized : HCP and Non-HCP.

### Triaging:

Triage is the assessment, classification & prioritization of the information received according to key regulatory, scientific and medical criteria.

Triage errors if not corrected in time can result in:

- Late regulatory reports
- Missed safety signals

Methods of Causality Assessment
Kramer Scale

### Suspect Causal Relation

- Definitely related - Events have no uncertainty in their relationship to test drug administration: meaning that a re-challenge was positive.
- Probable - Event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration, increases upon discontinuation of the drug
- Possible - Event may or may not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from drug administration but seems to be the type of reaction that cannot be dismissed as unlikely.
- Unlikely - No reasonable temporal association between the study drug and the suspected event
- Definitely unrelated -Events which occur prior to test drug administration or events which cannot be even remotely related to study participation

### Causality

To determine likelihood of a causal relationship between drug & adverse events:

- Association in time/place between drug use and event.
- Pharmacology (current knowledge of nature ).
- Medical/pharmacological plausibility (signs, symptoms, tests, mechanism).
- Likelihood or exclusion of other causes.

Common Questions to assess causality:

- Are there previous conclusive reports on this reaction?
- Did the ADR appear after the suspected drug was administered?
- Did the ADR improve when the drug was discontinued?
- Did the ADR appear with re-challenge?
- Are there alternative causes for the ADR?
- Did the reaction appear when placebo was given?
- Was the drug detected in blood at toxic levels?
- Was the reaction more severe when the dose was increased, or less severe when the dose was decreased?
- Did the patient have a similar reaction to the same or similar drug in any previous exposure?

#### NARANJO Algorithm

For assessing the causality

- definite - less than or equal to 9
- probable - 5-8
- possible - 1-4
- doubtful - 0

1.  Are there previous conclusive reports on this reaction? [ Yes +1 No 0 Dnk 0]
2.  Did the adverse event appear after the suspected drug was administered? [ Yes +2 No -1 Dnk 0]
3.  Did the adverse reaction improve when the drug was discontinued or a specific antagonist was administered? [ Yes +1 No 0 Dnk 0]
4.  Did the adverse event reappear when the drug was re-administered? [ Yes +2 No -1 Dnk 0]
5.  Are there alternative causes (other than the drug) that could on their own have caused the reaction? [ Yes -1 No +2 Dnk 0]
6.  Did the reaction reappear when a placebo was given?[ Yes -1 No +1 Dnk 0]
7.  Was the drug detected in blood (or other fluids) in concentrations known to be toxic? [ Yes +1 No 0 Dnk 0]
8.  Was the reaction more severe when the dose was increased or less severe when the dose was decreased? [ Yes +1 No 0 Dnk 0]
9.  Did the patient have similar reaction to the same or similar drugs in any previous exposure? [ Yes +1 No 0 Dnk 0]
10. Was the adverse event confirmed by any objective evidence? [ Yes +1 No 0 Dnk 0]

#### Hartwig and Seigels Scale

For assessing the severity

- Mild ADRs -are self limiting and do not contribute to prolongation of length of hospital stay.
- Moderate ADRs - require therapeutic intervention or hospital admission or prolonged hospital stay by at least one day.
- Severe ADRs - life threatening, requiring intensive medical care or produce disability or lead to death.

### Reporting Time Frames

#### Post-marketing 15-day "Alert reports"

The applicant shall report each adverse drug experience that is both serious and unexpected, as soon as possible but in no case later than 15 calendar days of initial receipt of the information by the applicant.

#### SUSAR (suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction)

This reporting needs to be done not later than seven days after the Sponsor was first aware of the reaction. Any additional relevant information should be sent within eight days of the report.

### Data Processing:

- The main functions of these steps are:
- Data entry into safety database from source document
- Coding (AEs & Products)
- Writing the case narrative Identifying missing information that should be pursued as queries for follow up

### Case Processing

- Duplicate search: Due to, greater awareness , stringent regulations and multiple reporting sources, duplicate reports is a common phenomenon. Every safety management software has a facility to identify and delete duplicates. Certain characteristics of a case (sex, age or date of birth, dates of drug exposure, clinical trial code, country, etc.) may be used to identify duplicate reporting. This action is of significance for further processing of the case.
- The duplicate could actually be follow up information that could alter the seriousness and hence reporting timeline of the case. Missed out duplicates could send misleading information to signal detection systems.

- Data Entry : Details of the four pillars of a valid case have to be reported meticulously. Patient information has to follow the HIPPA code for confidentiality. Reporter information has to clear and detailed enough to be able to contact the person if necessary. Drug identifiers like name, formulation and dose have to be captured correctly. Event report has to be detailed enough for the evaluator to decide on the cause of the adverse event. This would include chronological description of the event or events, nature, localization, severity, characteristics of the event, results of investigations and tests, start date, course and outcome, concomitant medications and other risk factors.

### Dictionary Classification

Medical classification, or medical coding, is the process of transforming descriptions into universal medical diagnoses & Procedure terms.

Purpose

- To code new and amended dictionary terms for purpose of standardization
- These terms could be Drug terms, Adverse Events, Diseases, Medical Procedures.
- To ensure consistent data classification across all protocols within a project as well as globally across all projects
- To classify similar verbatim text into predefined categories that represent medical concepts so that statistical reports can be generated for data analysis.

Coding for drugs

Both the suspect drug and concomitant medication have to be coded. The principle is again to be talking the same language across countries, companies and regulatory bodies. Most common dictionary is the WHO Drug Dictionary enhanced. This is provided as a product by the Upsala Monitoring centre of the WHO. Entries are updated 4 times a year. The majority of entries refer to prescription-only products, but some over-the-counter (OTC) preparations are included.

The dictionary also covers biotech and blood products, diagnostic substances and contrast media. For chemical and therapeutic groupings the WHO drug record number system and ATC classifications are considered.

Causality assessment

- Non spontaneous case reports usually indicate whether an adverse drug reaction is suspected due to the administered drug.
- In these circumstances and even otherwise, a causality assessment is required to be conducted.
- Various approaches have been developed for the structured determination of the likelihood of a causal relationship between drug exposure and adverse events.

These systems are largely based on following considerations:

- The chronology or association in time (or place) between drug administration and event current knowledge of nature and frequency of adverse reactions due to the suspect molecule; or the pharmacology
- Medical or pharmacological plausibility based on signs and symptoms, laboratory tests, pathological findings, mechanism of action
- Likelihood or exclusion of other causes for the same adverse events; often the disease condition or concomitant medication.

### Listedness/Labeldness/Expectedness:

- Listedness is based on the CCSI which is the core information on safety profile of molecule available with MAH.
- Expectedness is based on SmPC or PI which is a local label and is related to particular nation.
- It may happen that molecule A is having 10 SmPCs but as a rule each molecule is always has one CCSI. Also, CCSI may contain the less safety information which is available in each and every SmPC but vice-a-verse is not true. So rarely it may happen the event is unlisted but may be expected as per the local label (SmPC).
- CIOMS V provides a very elaborate explanation of Listedness/Labeldness/ and Expectedness.
- The purpose of Expectedness/Labeldness is to assess the reportability of the case to health authorities, whereas listedness, based on CCSI is for the generation of line-listings for PSURs.

### Case review

All cases should be reviewed after processing to ensure regulatory, scientific and medical standards are met

Case review is a 2 step process:

- Quality review
- Safety Assessment

Focus of Case Review:

- Completeness and Accuracy of data.
- Consistency of data entry with source documents
- Confirmation of the triage assessment of regulatory reportability
- Consistency with established report standards (ICH)
- Queries and Follow up information

### Narrative

- Summary of all relevant clinical information relating to an adverse event
- Relevant information
  - Electronic reporting currently limit on characters (20,000 characters)
- Presented in logical time sequence (medical story)
- Comprehensive details of individual cases (stand alone)

#### Key Elements of a Narrative:

- This is a spontaneous non serious report.
- A nurse reported that a 29 year old male consumer experienced stomach ache on 14Jun2008. while on therapy with oral aspirin
- The patient stated that he experienced burning type of stomach ache. The patient could not eat due to the pain in the stomach. The patient also could not sleep until early morning due to the stomach pain.
- He was taking aspirin 75mg two times a day orally for the treatment of low back pain from an unknown date.
- Medical history included high blood pressure and ulcerative colitis from an unknown date.
- Concomitant medications included oral acetaminophen 500mg, Vitamin B complex 180mg, from an unknown date.
- Investigations data; endoscopy was carried out on 19 June 2008 and the results were normal.
- Therapy with Aspirin was continuing at the time of the report.
- At the time of the report the clinical outcome of the event was unknown.

### Medical Review:

- Adverse Event (AE) Capture
  - Appropriateness of the AE terms selected
- Sequencing of the AEs
- Confirmation of Coding
- Confirmation of the Seriousness classification of the AE Terms
- Confirmation Listedness/Expectedness classification of AE Terms
- Reviews concurrent conditions, medical history
- Identification of any specific additional information needed for medical assessment
- Company causality assessment, wherever appropriate
- Identification of potential safety signals
- Timely reporting to authorities: this is the end goal for which all the above has to be done in a timely manner. The reporting could be by sending data back to the sponsor or by a click of a button based on the software used. The latter will provide an extra couple of days for case processing
- Safety data management is the most basic step in pharmacovigilance. This is often outsourced so that internal company resources can focus on the domain related, mentally stimulating activities like signal detection, regulatory responses, information to stakeholders

### Case Completion

- Case considered ready for completion when it has gone through triage, processing, review and approval

Case completion process includes:

- Any updates to the case as required by the review cycle
- incorporation of additional information requests into standard follow-up requests
- generation of final report & distribution of the final report to appropriate internal & external parties, including regulatory submission
- Archiving the report and accompanying source documents (both paper & electronic documents)

### Follow up Information

Recommendation to prioritize case reports by importance:

- Serious and unexpected
- Serious and expected
- Non-Serious and unexpected
- Cases of special interest (ADRs under surveillance; non-serious ADRs which may develop into serious ADRs)

- Follow up can be obtained by: Telephone; site visit; written request Written confirmation should be obtained wherever possible for the data supplied

- Judgement should be exercised for the extent of follow up and should be placed
- alongside the seriousness of the reported reaction and the known outcome (condition stabilized; resolved)
- It is recommended that MAHs should collaborate together if there is more than
- one MAHs drug suspected as a causal agent (interactions)
- ICH E2D has a list of key data elements which should be included wherever
- possible in expedited reports

#### Follow up related to pregnancy:

- Any pregnancy outcome where the reporter or Company decides may be related to the Company product, this should be reported as an expedited report under 15 calendar day rules
- All pregnancy cases should be followed to term
- If the Company product has long half life (or metabolites) even though the product was stopped before conception there is a possibility that drug/metabolite exposure could occur and recommendations in the label and for Company
- monitoring should occur

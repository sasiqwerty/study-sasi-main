# Types of reports

## Spontaneous reports

Spontaneous reports are pivotal and irreplaceable in providing safety information when a wider population is exposed to a new product.The clinical trials also aim to define the safety profile of the drug, at least in this selected population with this selected disease.

These studies, which are (usually) carried out with rigorous and highly regulated methodology, have significant limitations in defining the safety profile. They generally only find frequently occurring AEs.
This means that the uncommon AEs and even the fairly common AEs (e.g., an incidence of 1 in 500) will not be picked up until the drug is extensively used in the general population after marketing.
Also of note is that the clinical trials are often done in a narrow group of patients.
Polypharmacy and drug interactions, among other things, cannot be adequately studied in the pre-approval setting.
Hence, particular attention must be paid to the time just after a product is first marketed to fully understand the drug’s safety profile and minimize risks. In a sense, the first 500,000 to 1,000,000 patients prescribed the drug after launch are doing the large-scale safety testing.

What this means then is that the entire edifice of the drug safety system as it now stands depends on the good will and energy of nurses, pharmacists, physicians, and consumers to report AEs. Without them, no one would know of the AEs that are appearing as individual cases in isolated areas around the country or the world. These people must take time out of their day to report such events. The report will inevitably lead to a request for supplementary data (laboratory reports, cardiograms, hospital records, etc.) that are time and effort consuming. There is no evident or immediate gain to the reporter. The gain rather is to society at large, which is largely unaware of this noble effort.

The principles of the system are simple. All healthcare professionals (and consumers in most countries, including the United States, the European Union, and Canada) are encouraged to spontaneously report AEs to either the manufacturer or the governmental healthcare agency or a third party. Standardized forms have been developed (the MedWatch form in the United States, the CIOMS I form elsewhere) specifically for this purpose and are available online, in publications (e.g., the Physicians’ Desk Reference in the United States), as apps on the iPhone and other smartphones, and elsewhere. The form can be folded up and mailed (postage free), faxed, or filled in online and uploaded to the healthcare agencies. Phone reports and faxes to the manufacturer and most health agencies are also possible.

The forms are one or two pages in length and include the expected information requests: patient demographics; the AEs that occurred; medical history; drugs taken, including the one or more drugs suspected of causing the AE in question; co-medications; dose and timing; a narrative summary of the case; and reporter information. In most cases, confidentiality is guaranteed by law, regulation, or policy regarding the patient’s identity and the reporter’s identity. In online systems, the “forms” may be intelligent in the sense that the context determines which questions are asked. For example, if the patient is a male, the pregnancy questions will be eliminated from the online form.

## Aggregate reporting

There are multiple different safety reports that pharmaceutical companies and other sponsors must submit to health authorities.

Aggregate Reporting is the process that reviews the cumulative safety information from a wide range of sources, on a periodic basis and submit the findings to regulators worldwide.
Aggregate report examines and summarize all existing safety experience with a medicinal product. Report includes benefit risk assessment of SAES and ADRs, pregnancy reports, overdose and Lack of Efficacy reports.
The aggregate safety reports are submitted to regulators for as long as the medicine is marketed anywhere in the world and enables understanding of risk benefit profile of product over a period of time.

### Expedited Reporting

Certain serious adverse events (SAEs) must be reported to health authorities within 7 or 15 calendar days. Most countries use “calendar days” rather than “business or working days,” as holidays and working days are not the same everywhere. Some countries still retain different rules for local cases, but by and large, thanks to ICH, CIOMS, and common sense, most countries have standardized on the same timing, format, and content of expedited (also called “alert”) reports.

### Clinical Trial Reporting

Another way to express “clinical trial reporting” is reporting for drugs that are not yet marketed (no Marketing Authorization or New Drug Approval (NDA) yet or for the indication in question). Although this refers primarily to clinical trials, it may also refer to SAEs found in named patient use, compassionate use, solicited SAEs, epidemiologic trials, and other “non-classic” trials and studies.
Most countries require that SAEs, which are unexpected (not labeled), that is, do not appear in the product labeling that is usually the Investigator Brochure, and that have some possibility (even if small) of being caused by the study drug in question, be reported in 15 calendar days from the first notification of anyone in the company (or organization), including its agents, business partners, contractors, distributors, and vendors. This is called a “15day report,” “an expedited report,” or “an alert report.” Note the triple requirement: serious, unlabeled, and possibly related.

### Pre-marketing Reports

- NDA Annual Reports
- IND annual reports
- Clinical Study Reports (CSR)

### Post-marketing Reports

- Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR)
- Summary Bridging Report (SBR)
- Development Safety Update Report (DSUR)
- Annual Safety Reports (ASR)
- Periodic Adverse Drug Experiences Reports (PADER)

- PADER : Periodic adverse drug experience report
- PAER : Periodic adverse experience report periodic report in US.
- Quarterly during the first 3 years
- Annual reports thereafter

#### PSUR

The Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) is a report that summarizes interval safety data covering short periods of time and is used in overall safety evaluation of a product. It is a tool for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) to conduct systematic analyses of safety data on a regular basis.

The deadlines for the submission of PSURs are as follows:

- Every 6 months in the first two years following authorization and/or marketing.
- Every year in the next two years.
- Every 3 years thereafter

General principles of a PSUR

- One report for one active substance
- All indications, dosage forms and regimens
- Separate PSURs
  - fixed combinations
  - two or more different formulations, e.g., systemic vs topical
- One report to reach regulatory authority for the same time period
- Six-month interval data from international birth date (first approval anywhere)
- Report all relevant new information from appropriate sources
- Use of CCSI as reference product information

#### PBRER : Periodic benefit risk evaluation report

PSUR is replaced by PBRER
The main objective of a PBRER is to present a comprehensive, concise, and critical analysis of new or
emerging information on the risks of the medicinal product and on its benefit in approved indications,to enable an appraisal of the product's overall benefit-risk profile.

- The PBRER should contain an evaluation of new information relevant to the medicinal product that became available to the MAH during the reporting interval, in the context of cumulative information by
- Summarizing relevant new safety information that could have an impact on the benefit-risk profile of the medicinal product;
- Summarizing any important efficacy/effectiveness information that has become available during the reporting interval;
- Examining whether the information obtained by the MAH during the reporting interval is in accord with previous knowledge of the medicinal product's benefit and risk profile; and
- Where important new safety information has emerged, conducting an integrated benefit-risk evaluation for approved indications.

The MAH should continuously evaluate whether any revision of the reference product information/RSI is needed whenever new safety information is obtained throughout the reporting interval. Significant changes to the reference product information/RSI made during the interval should be described in Section 4 of the PBRER ("Changes to Reference Safety Information") and include:

- Changes to contraindications, warnings/precautions sections of the RSI;
- Addition of Adverse Drug Reaction(s) (ADR) and interactions;
- Addition of important new information on use in overdose; and
- Removal of an indication or other restrictions for safety or lack of efficacy reasons.

##### Timelines for PBRER:

Ad hoc ("for cause') PBRERs

Ad hoc PBRERs are reports outside the routine reporting requirements, and may be requested by some regulatory authorities. Where an ad hoc report is requested and a PBRER has not been prepared for a number of years, It is likely that a completely new report will need to be prepared by the MAR. Time Interval Between Data Lock Point and the Submission As a result of the expanded scope of the PBRER, the time interval between the DLP and submission of PBRERs should be as follows: • PBRERs covering intervals of 6 or 12 months: within 70 calendar days; o PBRERs covering intervals in excess of 12 months: within 90 calendar days; O ad hoc PBRERs, 90 calendar days, unless otherwise specified M the ad hoc request. The day of DLP is day 0 of the 70- or 90-calendar day interval between the DLP and report submission. Where national or regional requirements differ from the above, the MAH should discuss the timeline for submission with the relevant regulatory authority

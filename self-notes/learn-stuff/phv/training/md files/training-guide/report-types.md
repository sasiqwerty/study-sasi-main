# Types of reports

## Spontaneous reports

Spontaneous reports are pivotal and irreplaceable in providing safety information when a wider population is exposed to a new product.
The clinical trials also aim to define the safety profile of the drug, at least in this selected population with this selected disease.
These studies, which are (usually) carried out with rigorous and highly regulated methodology, have significant limitations in defining the safety profile. They generally only find frequently occurring AEs.
This means that the uncommon AEs and even the fairly common AEs (e.g., an incidence of 1 in 500) will not be picked up until the drug is extensively used in the general population after marketing.
Also of note is that the clinical trials are often done in a narrow group of patients.
Polypharmacy and drug interactions, among other things, cannot be adequately studied in the preapproval setting.
Hence, particular attention must be paid to the time just after a product is first marketed to fully understand the drug’s safety profile and minimize risks. In a sense, the first 500,000 to 1,000,000 patients prescribed the drug after launch are doing the largescale safety testing.
What this means then is that the entire edifice of the drug safety system as it now stands depends on the good will and energy of nurses, pharmacists, physicians, and consumers to report AEs. Without them, no one would know of the AEs that are appearing as individual cases in isolated areas around the country or the world. These people must take time out of their day to report such events. The report will inevitably lead to a request for supplementary data (laboratory reports, cardiograms, hospital records, etc.) that are time and effort consuming. There is no evident or immediate gain to the reporter. The gain rather is to society at large, which is largely unaware of this noble effort.
The principles of the system are simple. All healthcare professionals (and consumers in most countries, including the United States, the European Union, and Canada) are encouraged to spontaneously report AEs to either the manufacturer or the governmental healthcare agency or a third party. Standardized forms have been developed (the MedWatch form in the United States, the CIOMS I form elsewhere) specifically for this purpose and are available online, in publications (e.g., the Physicians’ Desk Reference in the United States), as apps on the iPhone and other smartphones, and elsewhere. The form can be folded up and mailed (postage free), faxed, or filled in online and uploaded to the healthcare agencies. Phone reports and faxes to the manufacturer and most health agencies are also possible.
The forms are one or two pages in length and include the expected information requests: patient demographics; the AEs that occurred; medical history; drugs taken, including the one or more drugs suspected of causing the AE in question; co-medications; dose and timing; a narrative summary of the case; and reporter information. In most cases, confidentiality is guaranteed by law, regulation, or policy regarding the patient’s identity and the reporter’s identity. In online systems, the “forms” may be intelligent in the sense that the context determines which questions are asked. For example, if the patient is a male, the pregnancy questions will be eliminated from the online form.

## Aggregate reporting

There are multiple different safety reports that pharmaceutical companies and other sponsors must submit to health authorities. This chapter reviews the key reports that are required now by most health authorities.

### Expedited Reporting

Certain serious adverse events (SAEs) must be reported to health authorities within 7 or 15 calendar days. Most countries use “calendar days” rather than “business or working days,” as holidays and working days are not the same everywhere. Some countries still retain different rules for local cases, but by and large, thanks to ICH, CIOMS, and common sense, most countries have standardized on the same timing, format, and content of expedited (also called “alert”) reports.

### Clinical Trial Reporting

Another way to express “clinical trial reporting” is reporting for drugs that are not yet marketed (no Marketing Authorization or New Drug Approval (NDA) yet or for the indication in question). Although this refers primarily to clinical trials, it may also refer to SAEs found in named patient use, compassionate use, solicited SAEs, epidemiologic trials, and other “non-classic” trials and studies.
Most countries require that SAEs, which are unexpected (not labeled), that is, do not appear in the product labeling that is usually the Investigator Brochure, and that have some possibility (even if small) of being caused by the study drug in question, be reported in 15 calendar days from the first notification of anyone in the company (or organization), including its agents, business partners, contractors, distributors, and vendors. This is called a “15day report,” “an expedited report,” or “an alert report.” Note the triple requirement: serious, unlabeled, and possibly related.

Aggregate Reporting is the process that reviews the cumulative safety information from a wide range of sources, on a periodic basis and submit the findings to regulators worldwide.
Aggregate report examines and summarize all existing safety experience with a medicinal product. Report includes benefit risk assessment of SAES and ADRs, pregnancy reports, overdose and Lack of Efficacy reports.
The aggregate safety reports are submitted to regulators for as long as the medicine is marketed anywhere in the world and enables understanding of risk benefit profile of product over a period of time.

### Pre-marketing Reports

- NDA Annual Reports
- IND annual reports
- Clinical Study Reports (CSR)

### Post-marketing Reports

- Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR)
- Summary Bridging Report (SBR)
- Development Safety Update Report (DSUR)
- Annual Safety Reports (ASR)
- Periodic Adverse Drug Experiences Reports (PADER)

- PADER : Periodic adverse drug experience report
- PAER : Periodic adverse experience report periodic report in US.
- Quarterly during the first 3 years
- Annual reports thereafter

The Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) is a report that summarizes interval safety data covering short periods of time and is used in overall safety evaluation of a product. It is a tool for Marketing Authorization Holders (MAHs) to conduct systematic analyses of safety data on a regular basis.

The deadlines for the submission of PSURs are as follows:

- Every 6 months in the first two years following authorization and/or marketing.
- Every year in the next two years.
- Every 3 years thereafter

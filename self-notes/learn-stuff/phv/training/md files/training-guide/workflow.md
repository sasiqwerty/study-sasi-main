## Individual Case Data Flow

The information is received from the reporters and the case is entered initially into the database. Later the case is cross-checked for duplicates and cleared to enter into the system as a new or a follow up case and registered. The next step in the process is triage where the case is judged based on its seriousness. The data is entered in the next step and the narrative is written and sent over to get reviewed by medical professionals. The case is closed after expert review and cleared to proceed for reporting.

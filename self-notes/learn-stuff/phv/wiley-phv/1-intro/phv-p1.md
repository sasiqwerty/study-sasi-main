# Introduction to Pharmacovigilance

The study of the safety of marketed drugs under the practical conditions of clinical use in large communities involves the paradox that what is probably the most highly regulated industry in the world is, from time to time, forced to remove approved and licensed products from the market because of clinical toxicity. Why is such close regulation not effective in preventing the withdrawal of licensed products? Why should the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry need, or be compelled, to withdraw licensed medicines for drug safety reasons? Why do these problems of licensed products being found toxic continue despite the accumulated experience of more than 45 years since the thalidomide tragedy?

- Partly, the problem is one of numbers,they remain far too small to detect uncommon or rare adverse drug reactions (ADRs), even if these are serious. The size of the licensing applications for important new drugs cannot be materially increased without delaying the marketing of new drugs to an extent damaging to diseased patients. Thus, because of this problem with numbers, drug safety depends very largely on the surveillance of medicines once they have been marketed.
- A second reason for difficulty is that the kinds of patients who receive licensed medicines are very different from the kinds of volunteers and patients in whom pre-marketing clinical trials are undertaken. The patients in formal clinical trials almost always have only one disease being treated with one drug. The drug, once licensed, is likely to be used in an older group of patients, many of whom will have more than one disease and be treated by polypharmacy. The drug may also be used in paediatric patients, who are generally excluded from initial clinical trials. The formal clinical trials may be a better test of efficacy than they are of safety under the practical conditions of everyday clinical usage.
- A third problem is that doctors may be slow or ineffective in detecting and reporting adverse drug effects.
- A fourth reason for difficulty is that drugs are often withdrawn from the market for what may be very rare adverse effects too infrequent by far to have shown up in the pre-licensing studies.

# Definitions

- Any adverse event associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, including the following:
  - An adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in professional practice
  - An adverse event occurring from drug overdose whether accidental or intentional
  - An adverse event occurring from drug abuse
  - An adverse event occurring from drug withdrawal
  - Any failure of expected pharmacological action
  - Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug-related.
- In practice most people use the term adverse event (AE) to refer to any “bad thing” that occurs during the use of a drug without implying that the bad thing is due to the drug. The bad thing may be due to the drug substance, excipients, packaging, or storage issues, and may or may not be due to the active ingredient.

# Adverse Reaction

- In the pre-approval or the experimental phase of a product, the definition is as follows: “All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions.”
  - This means “that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility.
- For post-approval or marketed products, the definition is as follows: “A response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or for modification of physiological function”.

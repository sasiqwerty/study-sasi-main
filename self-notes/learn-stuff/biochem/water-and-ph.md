## Explaining Chemical Reactions

The transfer(redistribution/restructuring) of electrons between the molecules in relative proximity leads to the formation of a new compound. The compound formed is only stable in a certain energy range and it will dissociate back into its respective groups when excited over that energy range. The stability of the compound formed also depends on the environment.

The transfer of electrons between(among ?) the molecules in relative proximity leads to the formation of compounds. The compounds formed can only be stable in a certain energy range and they will dissociate back into their respective groups when excited over that energy range. The stability of these compounds formed also (would also ?) depends(s) on the environment.

The water molecule being polar in nature tends to dissolve a lot of the compounds formed in chemical reactions and, if any unstable intermediates form are balanced by the polar groups.

## Explaining Hydrogen bonding

The water molecule is polar in nature, owing to its highly electronegative oxygen pulling the electrons closer to itself. This creates a dipole making the oxygen partially negative and the hydrogens partially positive. These hydrogens are attracted to the nearby oxygens of other water molecules and this process repeats itself until all the other water molecules are stabilised by the these attractive forces. This attractive force is called hydrogen bonding.

## Explaining Hydrophobic Interactions.

- Hydrophobic interaction refers to the self associativity of non polar compounds in an aqueous environment.
- Self association arises from the need to minimise energetically unfavourable interactions between water and non polar groups.
- While hydrogens of non polar groups do not form hydrogen bonds, they do affect the structure of the water that surrounds them.
- Water molecules adjacent to a hydrophobic group are restricted in the number of orientations that permit them to participate in maximum number of energetically favourable hydrogen bonds.
- The maximal formation of multiple hydrogen bonds can be maintained only in the increasing order of the adjacent water molecules with a corresponding decrease in entropy.
- It follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the optimal free energy of a hydrocarbon and water mixture is a function of both maximal enthalpy and minimum entropy.
- The enthalpy of the mixture is proportional to the number of hydrogen bonds and its entropy to the degrees of freedom.
- Thus non polar groups tend to form droplets with minimal exposed surface area, reducing the number of water molecules affected.

## Water and its tendency to disassociate

- The ionization of water can be represented as an intermolecular proton transfer that forms a hydronium ion and a hydroxide ion, but the transferred proton is associated with a cluster of water molecules. Protons exist in the solution not only as hydronium ions, but also as multimers of hydronium ions( its only represented as H+, but its in fact highly hydrated).
- its hard to talk about one proton in general, so think in terms of probability of hydrogen existing as an ion ( at any given point in time)

    <title>Introduction to Pharmacovigilance</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      No effective medicine is without risk, and full understanding of
      medicine’s safety profile is only achieved after wide clinical use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advent of new therapies which hold the promise of transforming disease
      outlook means that patients and healthcare professionals are unwilling to
      wait to access them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also means that the uncertainties around the balance of benefits and
      risks at the time of first availability of a new medicine may be greater
      than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      With every therapeutic advance, the boundaries between categories of
      healthcare products or medicines, advanced therapies, diagnostic agents –
      become ever more blurred and the practice of medicine more personalized to
      the individual patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The continuing need for the study of medicine’s safety in wider
      populations could perhaps be called into question.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the study of drug safety in clinical use has moved to centre
      stage in public health, precisely because of the recognition that although
      by and large adverse effects are rare, it is only by undertaking
      systematic large-scale surveillance that we can detect serious problems
      early and take prompt action to minimize harms – as it were, to‘fix it
      while you fly’.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pharmaceuticals are used internationally, and the need for effective drug
      safety monitoring is recognized worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      A signal of a safety issue associated with a new medicine introduced in a
      public health programme in a resource limited setting is just as relevant
      to a patient who may receive the same medicine in a high-tech healthcare
      environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The political landscape may shift, but pharmacovigilance knows no borders.
      The detection and evaluation of adverse effects associated with medicines
      involves specialists from a range of scientific disciplines who are
      attracted by the challenges of adding new knowledge that supports safe use
      of medicines.
    </p>

    <p>
      But pharmacovigilance can only be effective if it is relevant to the daily
      lives and embedded in the professional practice of all those who use
      medicines – the prescriber, the patient and their carer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is clear evidence that reports from patients provide invaluable
      information on the impact of an adverse effect on life and work, and are
      of an equivalent level of seriousness to those from healthcare
      professionals.
    </p>
    <p>
      This all adds up to the value of a broad appreciation and an up-to-date
      understanding of the principles and practice of pharmacovigilance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This new edition of a clear and succinct, yet comprehensive guide to the
      field, provides exactly the right introduction for those new to the
      challenges and the excitement of pharmacovigilance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It conveys the importance to public health protection of an effective
      safety net to pick up new information, and the need for well-planned
      strategies to generate new evidence as an enabler of innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone who uses a medicine has a part to play in helping to fill the
      knowledge gaps on safety in as near to real-time as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      While pharmacovigilance has now moved on to more robust forms of evidence
      than reliance on individual case reports of adverse effects, the alert
      prescriber or patient who observes a possible link between a medicine they
      are using, and an adverse effect is still the cornerstone of
      pharmacovigilance.

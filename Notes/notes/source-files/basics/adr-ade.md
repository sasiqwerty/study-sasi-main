# Understanding Adverse Drug Events and Reactions

## Introduction

The difference between an Adverse drug reaction and an Adverse event is crucial and yet these terms are widely misused.

In practice, determining whether a drug is responsible for a particular Adverse event in an individual patient is often difficult, and a judgement has to be made.

When the judgement is that the drug is a possible cause, this should be called a suspected Adverse drug reaction.

Reports of such suspicions form the basis of spontaneous Adverse drug reaction reporting schemes and the key point about such data is that they are a subset of all the Adverse events occurring during drug treatment which someone (generally a health professional who has seen the patient) has identified as possibly being drug-related.

It is the clinician's experience and professional judgement that enables him or her to suspect a drug as the cause but, of course, that suspicion may not be correct.

Proper use of the term Adverse event should imply that a more systematic data collection process has been used so that events will be included, regardless of whether anyone believes they might be caused by a drug.

In most clinical trials it is a standard practice to document all Adverse events and the best way of determining whether a drug is responsible for a particular type of event from such data is by comparison with a control group.

For example, if 10% of patients exposed to an active drug experienced headache compared to 2% on placebo, then this is an estimate that headache attributable to the drug occurs in 8% (i.e.10% minus 2%) of patients using it.

In such trials it is also common to ask investigators whether they believe that individual events are related to the drug.

This is effectively another way of collecting suspected Adverse drug reactions, although such data are likely to be more complete if the patient is in a clinical trial rather than being treated in ordinary practice.

It is important to realise that relying on clinical judgement is a methodologically weaker approach.

Providing that the estimated 8% difference is not based on very small numbers, then it would be more persuasive evidence that the drug causes headache.

Thus, the three terms should be applied in the following contexts: Use Adverse drug reaction to mean that it is now generally accepted that drug x may cause effect y rather than in relation to individual cases.

Qualify the term with 'possible' if there is doubt.

## Nature and Mechanism of Adverse Drug Reactions

The adverse effects of medicines usually mimic diseases or syndromes that occur naturally and have a variety of non‚Äêdrug potential causes.

As a general rule, considering other potential causes is an important part of the assessment of a potential adverse effect.

However, there are a few unique syndromes that, as far as we yet know, seem to be caused only by specific drugs.

Particularly at the time they are first identified, the mechanism of many ADRs is unknown or incompletely understood.

Understanding genetic predispositions is likely to be an important factor in determining how we might prevent ADRs in the future.

In broad terms, there are at least four mechanisms for ADRs:

- Exaggerated therapeutic response at the target site
- Desired pharmacological effect at another site
- Additional (secondary) pharmacological actions
- Triggering an immunological response

## Predisposing Factors for Adverse Drug Reactions

The main clinical factors that increase the chance that patients will experience an adverse reaction are as follows

- Age
- Gender
- sex
- ethnic origin
- impaired excretory mechanisms
- specific diseases
- polypharmacy
- Any previous history of an ADRDr

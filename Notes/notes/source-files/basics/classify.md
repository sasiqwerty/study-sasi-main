# Classification Systems

## A/B Classification system

Since the 1970s, ADRs have traditionally been classified into two broad categories: Types A and B. The usual characteristics of these different types of reactions are contrasted, followed by some examples:

- It is considered to be type "A" which stands for augmented, if the reactions are generally,
  - Dose‐related
  - Predictable from drug pharmacology
  - Common
  - Reversible
  - Manageable with dose adjustment.

- It is considered to be type "B" which stands for bizarre, if the reactions are generally,
  - not dose related
  - unpredictable
  - uncommon 
  - serious/irreversible
  - indicative that the drug needs to be stopped.

- There are few more that can be listed, they are type C for chronic, type D for delayed and type E for end of use.

## DoTS Classification

In 2003, a system of classification was proposed by Aronson and Ferner known as DoTS. It is based on
- dose‐relatedness
- time course
- susceptibility

The following terms are defined in the terms of dose-relatedness:
- *toxic* means that reactions occur as a result of drug levels being too high.
- *Collateral* means that reactions occur at drug levels that are in the usual therapeutic range.
- *­Hyper-susceptibility* means that reactions can occur even at very low, sub‐therapeutic doses.

The terms ‘early’, ‘intermediate’ and ‘late’ have not been precisely defined; the main difference between ‘late’ and ‘delayed’ reactions is that the latter can occur long after treatment is stopped.

A withdrawal reaction means one that is specifically precipitated by stopping the drug.

The DoTS approach is useful because it addresses the limitations of the Type A/B scheme into which many ADRs do not clearly fit and in providing pointers as to how specific ADRs can be avoided.

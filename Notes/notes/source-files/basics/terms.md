#### Identified risk

An untoward occurrence for which there is adequate evidence of an association with the medicinal product of interest (see ICH-E2F Guideline, Volume 10 of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the EU).

Examples include:

• an adverse reaction adequately demonstrated in non-clinical studies and confirmed by clinical data;

• an adverse reaction observed in well-designed clinical trials or epidemiological studies for which the magnitude of the difference, compared with the comparator group on a parameter of interest suggests a causal relationship;

• an adverse reaction suggested by a number of well-documented spontaneous reports where causality is strongly supported by temporal relationship and biological plausibility, such as anaphylactic reactions or application site reactions (see ICH-E2F Guideline, Volume 10 of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the EU).

In a clinical trial, the comparator may be placebo, an active substance or non-exposure.

Adverse reactions included in section 4.8 of the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) are also considered identified risks, unless they are class-related reactions which are mentioned in the SmPC but which are not specifically described as occurring with this product (these would normally be considered as a potential risk)).

#### Important identified risk and Important potential risk

An identified risk or potential risk that could have an impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product or have implications for public health (see ICH-E2F Guideline, Volume 10 of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the EU).

What constitutes an important risk will depend upon several factors, including the impact on the individual, the seriousness of the risk and the impact on public health. Normally, any risk that is likely to be included in the contraindications or warnings and precautions section of the product information should be considered important

(see Annex IV, ICH-E2C(R2) Guideline).

See also Risk-benefit balance, Identified risk, Potential risk, Safety concern

#### Important potential risk

See Important identified risk and Important potential risk  

#### Incident

A situation where an event occurs or new information arises, irrespective whether this is in the public domain or not, in relation to (an) authorised medicinal product(s) which could have a serious impact on public health.

The incident may be related to quality, efficacy or safety concerns, but most likely to safety and/or quality (and possibly subsequent supply shortages). In addition, situations that do not seem at a first glance to have a serious impact on public health, but are in the public domain - subject of media attention or not- and may lead to serious public concerns about the product, may also need to be considered as incidents. Likewise, other situations which might have a negative impact on the appropriate use of a medicinal products (e.g. resulting in patients stop taking their medicine) may fall within the definition of an incident.

In the context of this the European Union Regulatory Network Incident Management Plan for Medicines for Human Use Incident Management Plan, an incident relates to (a) medicinal product(s) authorised in the EU, irrespective of their route of authorisation.

#### Individual case safety report (ICSR); synonym: Adverse (drug) reaction report

For the purpose of validation of individual case safety reports as qualifying for reporting in the EU, see Module VI.

See also Individual case safety report

#### Missing information

Gaps in knowledge about a medicinal product, related to safety or use in particular patient populations, which could be clinically significant.

It is noted that there is an ICH definition for important missing information, which is: critical gaps in knowledge for specific safety issues or populations that use the marketed product (see Annex IV, ICH-E2C(R2) Guideline). The change of the EU term, to name this concept "missing information” rather than "important missing information”, is to be clear that in the EU a marketing authorisation cannot be granted if there are unacceptable gaps in knowledge, in accordance with Article 12 of REG (EC) No 726/2004 a marketing authorisation shall be refused if the quality, safety or efficacy are not properly or sufficiently demonstrated.

#### Misuse of a medicinal product

Situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the authorised product information.

See also Misuse of a medicinal product for illegal purposes

#### Misuse of a medicinal product for illegal purposes

Misuse for illegal purposes is misuse with the additional connotation of an intention of misusing the medicinal product to cause an effect in another person. This includes, amongst others: the sale, to other people, of medicines for recreational purposes and use of a medicinal product to facilitate assault.

See also Misuse of a medicinal product

#### Name of the medicinal product

The name which may be either an invented name not liable to confusion with the common name, or a common or scientific name accompanied by a trade mark or the name of the marketing authorisation holder .

The common name is the international non-proprietary name (INN) recommended by the World Health Organization, or, if one does not exist, the usual common name .

The complete name of the medicinal product is the name of the medicinal product followed by the strength and pharmaceutical form.

#### Newly identified signal

In periodic benefit-risk evaluation reports, a signal first identified during the reporting interval, prompting further actions or evaluation (see Annex IV, ICH-E2C(R2) Guideline).  

This definition could also apply to a previously closed signal for which new information becomes available in the reporting interval prompting further action or evaluation (see Annex IV, ICH-E2C(R2) Guideline).

This definition is also applicable to periodic safety update reports.

See also Signal, Closed signal

#### Non-interventional trial; synonym: Non-interventional study

A study where the medicinal product(s) is (are) prescribed in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the marketing authorisation. The assignment of the patient to a particular therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance by a trial protocol but falls within current practice and the prescription of the medicine is clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the study. No additional diagnostic or monitoring procedures shall be applied to the patients and epidemiological methods shall be used for the analysis of collected data .

Thus, a trial is non-interventional if the following requirements are cumulatively fulfilled:

• the medicinal product is prescribed in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the marketing authorisation;

• the assignment of the patient to a particular therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance by a trial protocol but falls within current practice and the prescription of the medicine is clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the study; and

• no additional diagnostic or monitoring procedures are applied to the patients and epidemiological methods are used for the analysis of collected data (see Volume 10 of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the EU, Questions & Answers Version 10.0).

Non-interventional studies are defined by the methodological approach used and not by the scientific objectives. Non-interventional studies include database research or review of records where all the events of interest have already happened (this may include case-control, cross-sectional, cohort and other study designs making secondary use of data). Non-interventional studies also include those involving primary data collection (e.g. prospective observational studies and registries in which the data collected derive from routine clinical care), provided that the conditions set out above are met. In these studies, interviews, questionnaires and blood samples may be performed as normal clinical practice.

Non-interventional trials do not fall in the scope of Directive 2001/20/EC.

#### Occupational exposure to a medicinal product

For the purpose of reporting cases of suspected adverse reactions, an exposure to a medicinal product as a result of one's professional or non-professional occupation.  

#### Off-label use

Situations where a medicinal product is intentionally used for a medical purpose not in accordance with the authorised product information.

Off-label use includes use in non-authorised paediatric age categories. Unless specifically requested, it does not include use outside the EU in an indication authorised in that territory which is not authorised in the EU.

#### Ongoing clinical trial

Trial where enrolment has begun, whether a hold is in place or analysis is complete, but for which a final clinical study report is not available (see ICH-E2F Guideline, Volume 10 of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the EU).

See also Clinical trial, Completed clinical trial

#### Ongoing signal

In periodic benefit-risk evaluation reports, a signal that remains under evaluation at the data lock point (see Annex IV, ICH-E2C(R2) Guideline).

This definition is also applicable to periodic safety update reports.

See also Signal, Data lock point

#### Overdose

Administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended dose according to the authorised product information. Clinical judgement should always be applied.  

#### Package leaflet

A leaflet containing information for the user which accompanies the medicinal product .  

#### Periodic safety update report (PSUR)

Format and content for providing an evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of a medicinal product for submission by the marketing authorisation holder at defined time points during the post-authorisation phase.

In the EU, periodic safety update reports should follow the format described in Module VII.

#### Pharmacovigilance

Science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other medicine-related problem (see WHO12).

In line with this general definition, underlying objectives of pharmacovigilance in accordance with the applicable EU legislation for are:

• preventing harm from adverse reactions in humans arising from the use of authorised medicinal products within or outside the terms of marketing authorisation or from occupational exposure; and

• promoting the safe and effective use of medicinal products, in particular through providing timely information about the safety of medicinal products to patients, healthcare professionals and the public.

Pharmacovigilance is therefore an activity contributing to the protection of patients' and public health.

#### Pharmacovigilance system

A system used by the marketing authorisation holder and by Member States to fulfil the tasks and responsibilities listed in Title IX of Directive 2001/83/EC and designed to monitor the safety of authorised medicinal products and detect any change to their risk-benefit balance .

In general, a pharmacovigilance system is a system used by an organisation to fulfil its legal tasks and responsibilities in relation to pharmacovigilance and designed to monitor the safety of authorised medicinal products and detect any change to their risk-benefit balance.

#### Pharmacovigilance system master file (PSMF)

A detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system used by the marketing authorisation holder with respect to one or more authorised medicinal products .

See also Pharmacovigilance system

#### Post-authorisation safety study (PASS)

Any study relating to an authorised medicinal product conducted with the aim of identifying, characterising or quantifying a safety hazard, confirming the safety profile of the medicinal product, or of measuring the effectiveness of risk management measures .

A post-authorisation safety study may be an interventional clinical trial or may follow an observational, non-interventional study design.

See also Clinical trial, Non-interventional trial

#### Potential risk

An untoward occurrence for which there is some basis for suspicion of an association with the medicinal product of interest but where this association has not been confirmed (see ICH-E2F Guideline, Volume 10 of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the EU).

Examples include:

• non-clinical toxicological findings that have not been observed or resolved in clinical studies;

• adverse events observed in clinical trials or epidemiological studies for which the magnitude of the difference, compared with the comparator group (placebo or active substance, or unexposed group), on the parameter of interest raises a suspicion of, but is not large enough to suggest, a causal relationship;

• a signal arising from a spontaneous adverse reaction reporting system;

• an event known to be associated with other active substances within the same class or which could be expected to occur based on the properties of the medicinal product (based on ICH-E2F Guideline, Volume 10 of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the EU).

#### Reference safety information

In periodic benefit-risk evaluation reports for medicinal products, all relevant safety information contained in the reference product information (e.g. the company core data sheet) prepared by the marketing authorisation holder and which the marketing authorisation holder requires to be listed in all countries where it markets the product, except when the local regulatory authority specifically requires a modification (see Annex IV, ICH-E2C(R2) Guideline).

  

It is a subset of information contained within the marketing authorisation holder's reference product information for the periodic benefit-risk evaluation report. Where the reference product information is the company core data sheet, the reference safety information is the company core safety information (see Annex IV, ICH-E2C(R2) Guideline).

See also Company core data sheet, Company core safety information

#### Registry

An organised system that uses observational methods to collect uniform data on specified outcomes in a population defined by a particular disease, condition or exposure.  

#### Risk management plan (RMP)

A detailed description of the risk management system .

To this end, it must identify or characterise the safety profile of the medicinal product(s) concerned, indicate how to characterise further the safety profile of the medicinal product(s) concerned, document measures to prevent or minimise the risks associated with the medicinal product, including an assessment of the effectiveness of those interventions and document post-authorisation obligations that have been imposed as a condition of the marketing authorisation .

See also Risk management system, Risk minimisation activity

#### Risk management system

A set of pharmacovigilance activities and interventions designed to identify, characterise, prevent or minimise risks relating to a medicinal product, including the assessment of the effectiveness of those interventions .  

#### Risk minimisation activity; synonym: Risk minimisation measure

An intervention intended to prevent or reduce the probability of the occurrence of an adverse reaction associated with the exposure to a medicine, or to reduce its severity should it occur.

These activities may consist of routine risk minimisation (e.g. product information) or additional risk minimisation activities (e.g. healthcare professional or patient communications/educational materials).

#### Risk-benefit balance

An evaluation of the positive therapeutic effects of the medicinal product in relation to the risks , i.e. any risk relating to the quality, safety or efficacy of the medicinal product as regards patients' health or public health .

See also Risks related to use of a medicinal product

#### Risks related to use of a medicinal product

Any risk relating to the quality, safety or efficacy of the medicinal product as regards patients' health or public health and any risk of undesirable effects on the environment .  

#### Safety concern

An important identified risk, important potential risk or missing information.

It is noted that the ICH definition of safety concern is: an important identified risk, important potential risk or important missing information, i.e. includes the qualifier "important” in relation to missing information (see Annex IV, ICH-E2C(R2) Guideline). The ICH-E2E Guideline (see Annex IV) uses the terms safety issue and safety concern interchangeably with the same definition for safety concern as defined in the ICH-E2C(R2) Guideline.

See also Important identified risk and Important potential risk, Missing information

#### Serious adverse reaction

An adverse reaction which results in death, is life-threatening, requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .

Life-threatening in this context refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe (see Annex IV, ICH-E2D Guideline).

Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but might jeopardise the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation or development of dependency or abuse (see Annex IV, ICH-E2D Guideline).

Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction.

See also Adverse reaction

#### Signal

Information arising from one or multiple sources, including observations and experiments, which suggests a new potentially causal association, or a new aspect of a known association between an intervention and an event or set of related events, either adverse or beneficial, that is judged to be of sufficient likelihood to justify verificatory action .

For the purpose of monitoring data in the EudraVigilance database, only signals related to an adverse reaction shall be considered .

For the purpose of Section 16.2 of the periodic benefit-risk evaluation report, signals relate to adverse effects (see Annex IV, ICH-E2C(R2) Guideline).

See also Validated signal, Newly identified signal, Closed signal, Ongoing signal, Signal management process, Adverse reaction

#### Signal management process

Includes the following activities: signal detection, signal validation, signal confirmation, signal analysis and prioritisation, signal assessment and recommendation for action .

It therefore is a set of activities performed to determine whether, based on an examination of individual case safety reports (ICSRs), aggregated data from active surveillance systems or studies, literature information or other data sources, there are new risks causally associated with an active substance or a medicinal product or whether known risks have changed.

See also Signal validation

#### Signal validation

Process of evaluating the data supporting a detected signal in order to verify that the available documentation contains sufficient evidence demonstrating the existence of a new potentially causal association, or a new aspect of a known association, and therefore justifies further analysis of the signal .

See also Validated signal

#### Solicited sources of individual case safety reports

Organised data collection systems, which include clinical trials, registries, post-authorisation named- patients use programmes, other patient support and disease management programmes, surveys of patients or healthcare providers or information gathering on efficacy or patient compliance. For the purpose of safety reporting, solicited reports should not be considered spontaneous but classified as individual case safety reports from studies and therefore should have an appropriate causality assessment by a healthcare professional or the marketing authorisation holder (see Annex IV, ICH- E2D).

See also Clinical trial, Post-authorisation safety study, Non-interventional trial

#### Spontaneous report, synonym: Spontaneous notification

An unsolicited communication by a healthcare professional or consumer to a company, regulatory authority or other organisation (e.g. the World Health Organization, a regional centre, a poison control centre) that describes one or more adverse reactions in a patient who was given one or more medicinal products and that does not derive from a study or any organised data collection scheme (see Annex IV, ICH-E2D).

In this context, an adverse reaction refers to a suspected adverse reaction.

Stimulated reporting can occur in certain situations, such as after a direct healthcare professional communication (DHPC), a publication in the press or questioning of healthcare professionals by company representatives, and adverse reaction reports arising from these situations are considered spontaneous reports (see Annex IV, ICH-E2D), provided the report meets the definition above. Reporting can also be stimulated by invitation from patients' or consumers' organisations to their members. Reporting made in the context of early post-marketing phase vigilance (EPPV), e.g. in Japan, is also considered stimulated reporting.

See also Adverse reaction

#### Stimulated reporting

See Spontaneous report  

#### Substance

#### Traditional herbal medicinal product

A herbal medicinal product that fulfils the conditions laid down in Article 16a(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC , i.e.

(a) it has (an)indication(s) exclusively appropriate to traditional herbal medicinal products which, by virtue of their composition and purpose, are intended and designed for use without the supervision of a medical practitioner for diagnostic purposes or for prescription or monitoring of treatment;

(b) it is exclusively for administration in accordance with a specified strength and posology;

(c) it is an oral, external and/or inhalation preparation;

(d) the period of traditional use as laid down in Article 16c(1)(c) has elapsed;

(e) the data on the traditional use of the medicinal product are sufficient; in particular the product proves not to be harmful in the specified conditions of use and the pharmacological effects or efficacy of the medicinal product are plausible on the basis of long-standing use and experience .

Regarding (d), the product must have been in medicinal use throughout a period of at least 30 years, including at least 15 years within the EU (see DIR 2001/83/EC Art 16c(c) and European Commission Questions & Answers Document on Registration of Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products, 2011).

#### Unexpected adverse reaction

An adverse reaction, the nature, severity or outcome of which is not consistent with the summary of product characteristics 13.

This includes class-related reactions which are mentioned in the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) but which are not specifically described as occurring with this product. For products authorised nationally, the relevant SmPC is that authorised by the competent authority in the Member State to whom the reaction is being reported. For centrally authorised products, the relevant SmPC is the SmPC authorised by the European Commission. During the time period between a CHMP opinion in favour of granting a marketing authorisation and the Commission decision granting the marketing authorisation, the relevant SmPC is the SmPC annexed to the CHMP opinion.

#### Upper management

Group of persons in charge of the highest executive management of an organisation.

Membership of this group is determined by the governance structure of the organisation. While it is envisaged that the upper management usually is a group, the head of the organisation is the one person at the top of the organisation with ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the organisation complies with relevant legislation.

#### Vaccination

The administration of a vaccine with the aim to produce immune response.

See also Immunisation

#### Vaccination failure

Vaccination failure due to actual vaccine failure or failure to vaccinate (see CIOMS-WHO14).

Vaccination failure may be defined based on clinical endpoints or immunological criteria, where correlates or surrogate markers for disease protection exist. Primary failure (e.g. lack of seroconversion or seroprotection) needs to be distinguished from secondary failure (waning immunity) (see CIOMS-WHO14).

See also Vaccine failure, Failure to vaccinate

#### Vaccine

See Immunological medicinal product  

#### Vaccine failure

Confirmed or suspected vaccine failure.

**Confirmed clinical vaccine failure**

Occurrence of the specific vaccine-preventable disease in a person who is appropriately and fully vaccinated taking into account the incubation period and the normal delay for the protection to be acquired as a result of immunisation (see CIOMS-WHO15).

**Suspected clinical vaccine failure**

Occurrence of disease in an appropriately and fully vaccinated person, but the disease is not confirmed to be the specific vaccine-preventable disease, e.g. disease of unknown serotype in a fully vaccinated person (based on CIOMS-WHO15).

**Confirmed immunological vaccine failure**

Failure of the vaccinated person to develop the accepted marker of protective immune response after being fully and appropriately vaccinated, as demonstrated by having tested or examined the vaccinated person at an appropriate time interval after completion of immunisation (based on CIOMS- WHO15).

**Suspected immunological vaccine failure**

Failure of the vaccinated person to develop the accepted marker of protective immune response after being fully and appropriately vaccinated, but with the testing or examination of the vaccinated person done at an inappropriate time interval after completion of immunisation (based on CIOMS-WHO15).

For interpreting what means appropriately vaccinated, consider the explanatory note for Immunisation error-related reaction.

#### Vaccine pharmacovigilance

The science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and communication of adverse events following immunisation and other vaccine- or immunisation-related issues, and to the prevention of untoward effects of the vaccine or immunisation (see CIOMS-WHO16).

In this definition, immunisation means the usage of a vaccine for the purpose of immunising individuals (see CIOMS-WHO16), which in the EU is preferably referred to as vaccination (in the report of CIOMS/WHO Working Group on Vaccine Pharmacovigilance the terms immunisation and vaccination are used interchangeably16). Usage includes all processes that occur after a vaccine product has left the manufacturing/packaging site, i.e. handling, prescribing and administration of the vaccine (see CIOMS-WHO16).

An adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) is any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunisation and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine. The adverse event may be any unfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease. While this AEFI definition is compatible with the definition of adverse event applied in the EU, the AEFI definition is not needed to describe pharmacovigilance for vaccines in the EU. However, EU guidance on pharmacovigilance for vaccines makes use of the terminology suggested by CIOMS-WHO16 regarding possible causes of adverse events, turning them into suspected adverse reactions. A coincidental event is an AEFI that is caused by something other than the vaccine product, immunisation error or immunisation anxiety (see CIOMS-WHO16).

#### Vaccine product-related reaction

An adverse event following immunisation that is caused or precipitated by a vaccine due to one or more of the inherent properties of the vaccine product (see CIOMS-WHO17).  

In this definition immunisation means the usage (handling, prescribing and administration) of a vaccine for the purpose of immunising individuals (see CIOMS-WHO17), which in the EU is preferably referred to as vaccination (in the report of CIOMS/WHO Working Group on Vaccine Pharmacovigilance the terms immunisation and vaccination are used interchangeably17).

See also Adverse reaction, Vaccine pharmacovigilance

#### Vaccine quality defect-related reaction

An adverse event following immunisation that is caused or precipitated by a vaccine that is due to one or more quality defects of the vaccine product including its administration device as provided by the manufacturer (see CIOMS-WHO18).

In this definition immunisation means the usage (handling, prescribing and administration) of a vaccine for the purpose of immunising individuals (see CIOMS-WHO18), which in the EU is preferably referred to as vaccination (in the report of CIOMS/WHO Working Group on Vaccine Pharmacovigilance the terms immunisation and vaccination are used interchangeably18).

For the purpose of this definition, a vaccine quality defect is defined as any deviation of the vaccine product as manufactured from its set quality specifications (see CIOMS-WHO18).

    <h4 id="abuse-of-a-medicinal-product">Abuse of a medicinal product</h4>
    <p>
      Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of medicinal products
      which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects [DIR
      2001/83/EC Art 1(16)].
    </p>
    <h4 id="advanced-therapy-medicinal-product-atmp">
      Advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP)
    </h4>
    <p>
      A medicinal product for human use that is either a gene therapy medicinal
      product, a somatic cell therapy product or a tissue engineered products as
      defined in Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 [Reg (EC) No 1394/2077 Art 1(1)].
    </p>
    <h4 id="adverse-event-ae-synonym-adverse-experience">
      Adverse event (AE); synonym: Adverse experience
    </h4>
    <p>
      Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject
      administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a
      causal relationship with this treatment [Dir 2001/20/EC Art 2(m)].
    </p>
    <p>
      An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign
      (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally
      associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered
      related to the medicinal product.

    </h4>
    <p>
      A response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended [DIR
      2001/83/EC Art 1(11)]1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a
      medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable
      possibility (see Annex IV, ICH-E2A Guideline).
    </p>
    <p>
      Adverse reactions may arise from use of the product within or outside the
      terms of the marketing authorisation or from occupational exposure [DIR
      2001/83/EC Art 101(1)]. Conditions of use outside the marketing
      authorisation include off-label use, overdose, misuse, abuse and
      medication errors.

      Volume 10 of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the EU).
    </p>
    <p>Examples include:</p>
    <p>
      • an adverse reaction adequately demonstrated in non-clinical studies and
      confirmed by clinical data;
    </p>
    <p>
      • an adverse reaction observed in well-designed clinical trials or
      epidemiological studies for which the magnitude of the difference,
      compared with the comparator group on a parameter of interest suggests a
      causal relationship;
    </p>
    <p>
      • an adverse reaction suggested by a number of well-documented spontaneous
      reports where causality is strongly supported by temporal relationship and
      biological plausibility, such as anaphylactic reactions or application
      site reactions (see ICH-E2F Guideline, Volume 10 of the Rules Governing
      Medicinal Products in the EU).
    </p>
    <p>
      In a clinical trial, the comparator may be placebo, an active substance or
      non-exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adverse reactions included in section 4.8 of the summary of product
      characteristics (SmPC) are also considered identified risks, unless they
      are class-related reactions which are mentioned in the SmPC but which are
      not specifically described as occurring with this product (these would
      normally be considered as a potential risk)).

      The incident may be related to quality, efficacy or safety concerns, but
      most likely to safety and/or quality (and possibly subsequent supply
      shortages). In addition, situations that do not seem at a first glance to
      have a serious impact on public health, but are in the public domain -
      subject of media attention or not- and may lead to serious public concerns
      about the product, may also need to be considered as incidents. Likewise,
      other situations which might have a negative impact on the appropriate use
      of a medicinal products (e.g. resulting in patients stop taking their

      "missing information” rather than "important missing information”, is to
      be clear that in the EU a marketing authorisation cannot be granted if
      there are unacceptable gaps in knowledge, in accordance with Article 12 of

      assignment of the patient to a particular therapeutic strategy is not
      decided in advance by a trial protocol but falls within current practice
      and the prescription of the medicine is clearly separated from the
      decision to include the patient in the study. No additional diagnostic or
      monitoring procedures shall be applied to the patients and epidemiological
      methods shall be used for the analysis of collected data [Dir 2001/20/EC

    <p>
      Non-interventional studies are defined by the methodological approach used
      and not by the scientific objectives. Non-interventional studies include
      database research or review of records where all the events of interest
      have already happened (this may include case-control, cross-sectional,
      cohort and other study designs making secondary use of data).
      Non-interventional studies also include those involving primary data
      collection (e.g. prospective observational studies and registries in which
      the data collected derive from routine clinical care), provided that the
      conditions set out above are met. In these studies, interviews,
      questionnaires and blood samples may be performed as normal clinical

      results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a
      congenital anomaly/birth defect [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(12)].
    </p>
    <p>
      Life-threatening in this context refers to a reaction in which the patient
      was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a
      reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe (see
      Annex IV, ICH-E2D Guideline).
    </p>
    <p>
      Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether
      other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important
      medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in
      death or hospitalisation but might jeopardise the patient or might require
      intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Examples
      of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for
      allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result
      in hospitalisation or development of dependency or abuse (see Annex IV,

      It therefore is a set of activities performed to determine whether, based
      on an examination of individual case safety reports (ICSRs), aggregated
      data from active surveillance systems or studies, literature information
      or other data sources, there are new risks causally associated with an
      active substance or a medicinal product or whether known risks have
      changed.

      An unsolicited communication by a healthcare professional or consumer to a
      company, regulatory authority or other organisation (e.g. the World Health
      Organization, a regional centre, a poison control centre) that describes
      one or more adverse reactions in a patient who was given one or more
      medicinal products and that does not derive from a study or any organised
      data collection scheme (see Annex IV, ICH-E2D).

    <p>
      In this context, an adverse reaction refers to a suspected adverse
      reaction.

      Stimulated reporting can occur in certain situations, such as after a
      direct healthcare professional communication (DHPC), a publication in the
      press or questioning of healthcare professionals by company
      representatives, and adverse reaction reports arising from these
      situations are considered spontaneous reports (see Annex IV, ICH-E2D),
      provided the report meets the definition above. Reporting can also be
      stimulated by invitation from patients’ or consumers’ organisations to
      their members. Reporting made in the context of early post-marketing phase
      vigilance (EPPV), e.g. in Japan, is also considered stimulated reporting.

    <p><strong>Confirmed clinical vaccine failure</strong></p>
    <p>
      Occurrence of the specific vaccine-preventable disease in a person who is
      appropriately and fully vaccinated taking into account the incubation
      period and the normal delay for the protection to be acquired as a result
      of immunisation (see CIOMS-WHO15).

    <p><strong>Suspected clinical vaccine failure</strong></p>
    <p>
      Occurrence of disease in an appropriately and fully vaccinated person, but
      the disease is not confirmed to be the specific vaccine-preventable
      disease, e.g. disease of unknown serotype in a fully vaccinated person
      (based on CIOMS-WHO15).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Confirmed immunological vaccine failure</strong></p>
    <p>
      Failure of the vaccinated person to develop the accepted marker of

    <h4 id="vaccine-pharmacovigilance">Vaccine pharmacovigilance</h4>
    <p>
      The science and activities relating to the detection, assessment,
      understanding and communication of adverse events following immunisation
      and other vaccine- or immunisation-related issues, and to the prevention
      of untoward effects of the vaccine or immunisation (see CIOMS-WHO16).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this definition, immunisation means the usage of a vaccine for the
      purpose of immunising individuals (see CIOMS-WHO16), which in the EU is
      preferably referred to as vaccination (in the report of CIOMS/WHO Working
      Group on Vaccine Pharmacovigilance the terms immunisation and vaccination
      are used interchangeably16). Usage includes all processes that occur after
      a vaccine product has left the manufacturing/packaging site, i.e.
      handling, prescribing and administration of the vaccine (see CIOMS-WHO16).
    </p>
    <p>
      An adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) is any untoward medical
      occurrence which follows immunisation and which does not necessarily have
      a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine. The adverse event may
      be any unfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding,
      symptom or disease. While this AEFI definition is compatible with the
      definition of adverse event applied in the EU, the AEFI definition is not
      needed to describe pharmacovigilance for vaccines in the EU. However, EU
      guidance on pharmacovigilance for vaccines makes use of the terminology
      suggested by CIOMS-WHO16 regarding possible causes of adverse events,
      turning them into suspected adverse reactions. A coincidental event is an
      AEFI that is caused by something other than the vaccine product,
      immunisation error or immunisation anxiety (see CIOMS-WHO16).

    <p>
      In every interview that you might attend, you always wish to know the
      questions beforehand. However, you should keep in mind that the panel
      sitting in front of you is experienced and can go a step higher if you can
      steer clear from their simple volleys. No list of questions or guide is
      perfect but they all are for the preparation of better good. We bring
      forth to you a list of few academic questions that might make the tortuous
      path a little easier.

    <h2 id="what-is-pharmacovigilance">What is Pharmacovigilance?</h2>
    <p>
      Pharmacovigilance has been defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO)
      as “The science and activities relating to the detection, assessment,
      understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other possible
      drug-related problem”
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-are-the-minimum-criteria-required-for-a-valid-case">
      What are the minimum criteria required for a valid case?
    </h2>
    <p>An identifiable reporter</p>
    <p>An identifiable patient</p>
    <p>A suspect product</p>
    <p>An adverse drug event</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-an-adverse-drug-event-ade">
      What is an Adverse Drug Event (ADE)?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The ICH E2A guideline describes Adverse Events as any “untoward medical
      occurrence” which happens to either a patient or a subject in a clinical
      investigation when a pharmaceutical product has been given to that person.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-an-adverse-drug-reaction-adr">
      What is an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)?
    </h2>
    <p>
      ICH E2A characterizes Adverse Reactions according to the stage of the
      medicinal product’s life cycle. If the product has not yet been marketed,
      Adverse Reactions are any “noxious and unintended responses” to the
      product at any dose. The effect of this classification is to reasonably
      establish that a relationship between the product and the reaction “cannot
      be ruled out”. Once the product has been placed in the market, “Adverse
      Reactions” encompass responses which are again “noxious and unintended”
      but occur at the established routine dosages which have been defined for
      use in humans to prevent, diagnose, or treat disease or modify
      “physiological function”.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-an-ade-and-adr">
      What is the difference between an ADE and ADR?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Adverse drug event and adverse drug reaction both are adverse occurrences.
      If one finds the causality for adverse occurrence its adverse drug
      reaction and if one fails to find causality for adverse occurrence then it
      is referred to as adverse drug event.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-do-you-mean-by-causality">What do you mean by causality?</h2>
    <p>
      Causality is the relationship between a set of factors. In
      Pharmacovigilance, causality is the relationship between the suspect
      product and the adverse drug event.
    </p>
    <h2 id="when-do-you-consider-an-event-to-be-serious">
      When do you consider an event to be serious?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If an event is associated with any one of the following, it is considered
      to be serious
    </p>
    <p>Death</p>
    <p>Life threatening</p>
    <p>Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization.</p>
    <p>Congenital anomaly /Birth Defect</p>
    <p>Disability</p>
    <p>Requiring intervention to prevent permanent damage or impairment</p>
    <p>Medically significant</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-the-yellow-card-in-pharmacovigilance">
      What is the yellow card in pharmacovigilance?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Yellow Card Scheme is the UK system for collecting information on
      suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to medicines. The scheme allows
      the safety of the medicines and vaccines that are on the market to be
      monitored. The Scheme was founded in 1964 after the thalidomide disaster,
      and was developed by Bill Inman.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-informed-consent">What is informed consent?</h2>
    <p>
      Informed consent is a process for getting permission before conducting a
      healthcare intervention on a person, or for disclosing personal
      information.

    <h2 id="what-is-volume-9a">What is Volume 9A?</h2>
    <p>
      Volume 9A brings together “The rules governing medicinal products in the
      European Union”contains  general guidance on the requirements, procedures,
      roles and activities in this field, for both Marketing Authorisation
      Holders and Competent Authorities of medicinal products for human use; it
      incorporates international agreements reached within the framework of the
      International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH). With the application of
      the new pharmacovigilance legislation as from July 2012 Volume 9A is
      replaced by the good pharmacovigilance practice (GVP) guidelines released
      by the European Medicines Agency.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-do-the-different-part-of-volume-9a-deal-with">
      What do the different part of Volume 9A deal with?
    </h2>
    <p>Part I deals with Guidelines for Marketing Authorisation Holders</p>
    <p>
      Part II deals with Guidelines for Competent Authorities and the Agency
    </p>
    <p>
      Part III provides the Guidelines for the electronic exchange of
      pharmacovigilance in the EU
    </p>
    <p>Part IV provides Guidelines on pharmacovigilance communication</p>
    <h2 id="difference-between-nda-and-anda">
      Difference between NDA and ANDA?
    </h2>
    <p>
      NDA means New Drug Application. When the sponsor of the new drug believes
      that enough evidence on the drug’s safety and effectiveness has been
      obtained to meet the FDA’s requirements for marketing approval, the
      sponsor submits to the FDA a new drug application. ANDA means Abbreviated
      New Drug Application. It contains data that, when submitted to FDA,
      provides for the review and ultimate approval of a generic drug product.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-are-the-phases-of-clinical-trials">
      What are the phases of clinical trials?
    </h2>
    <p>Phase I studies assess the safety of a drug or device.</p>
    <p>Phase II studies test the efficacy of a drug or device.</p>
    <p>
      Phase III studies involve randomized and blind testing in several hundred
      to several thousand patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phase IV studies, often called Post Marketing Surveillance Trials, are
      conducted after a drug or device has been approved for consumer sale.

    <p>
      The United States Food and Drug Administration’s Investigational New Drug
      (IND) program is the means by which a pharmaceutical company obtains
      permission to ship an experimental drug across state lines (usually to
      clinical investigators) before a marketing application for the drug has
      been approved.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-eudravigilance">What is EudraVigilance?</h2>
    <p>
      The European Union data-processing network and management system,
      established by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to support the
      electronic exchange, management, and scientific evaluation of Individual
      Case Safety Reports related to all medicinal products authorised in the
      European Economic Area (EEA). EudraVigilance also incorporates data
      analysis facilities.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-are-the-types-of-pharmacovigilance-pv">
      What are the types of Pharmacovigilance (PV)?
    </h2>
    <p>Two types</p>
    <p><strong>Active PV</strong></p>
    <p>
      Active PV: Active (or proactive) safety surveillance means that active
      measures are taken to detect adverse events. This is managed by active
      follow-up after treatment and the events may be detected by asking
      patients directly or screening patient records.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Passive PV</strong></p>
    <p>
      Passive PV: Passive surveillance means that no active measures are taken
      to look for adverse effects other than the encouragement of health
      professionals and others to report safety concerns.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-are-the-due-dates-for-safety-reporting">
      What are the due dates for safety reporting?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Safety reporting due dates are 7 days for IND Reporting and 15 days for
      NDA Reporting
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-inverted-black-triangle-in-pharmacovigilance">
      What is inverted Black triangle in Pharmacovigilance?
    </h2>
    <p>
      A black triangle appearing after the trade name of a British medicine
      indicates that the medication is new to the market, or that an existing
      medicine (or vaccine) is being used for a new reason or by a new route of
      administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black triangle also highlights the need for surveillance of
      any adverse drug reaction (ADRs) that might arise from the use of a new
      medication.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-pharmacovigilance-programme-of-india-pvpi">
      What is Pharmacovigilance Programme of India (PvPI)?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), New Delhi has
      initiated a nation-wide pharmacovigilance programme under the aegis of
      Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare, Government of India. The
      programme is coordinated by The Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission (IPC)
      located at Ghaziabad. The National Coordinating Centre (NCC) is operating
      under the supervision of Steering Committee to recommend procedures and
      guidelines for regulatory interventions in India.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-a-signal">What is a signal?</h2>
    <p>
      A ‘signal’ consists of reported information on a possible causal
      relationship between an adverse event and a drug, the relationship being
      unknown or incompletely documented previously. Usually more than a single
      report is required to generate a signal, depending upon the seriousness of
      the event and the quality of the information.

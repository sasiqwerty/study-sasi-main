The two most important concepts in pharmacovigilance are opposites: harm and safety.

The usual term for harm related to a medicine is an adverse drug reaction (ADR).

Pharmacovigilance is fundamentally about preventing and managing ADRs.

A side effect is an unintended effect of a medicine. Normally, it is undesirable but it could be beneficial.

An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an unintended and noxious effect that is attributable to a medicine when it has been given within the normal range of doses used in humans.

An adverse event (AE) is an undesirable occurrence that occurs in the context of drug treatment but which may or may not be causally related to a medicine.

## Some Logic

we choose to do things, most of the time the choices are subconscious, in rare we know the outcomes and we still choose to go with it.

Our emotions are linked to the experiences from our collective human past.

We are programmed to cry when we feel sad,to laugh when we feel happy and so on. the idea is to not express the emotions which is secondary rather it is to experience it and remember it. The act of crying makes us sad, the act of laughing makes us happy, other faces other emotions. This makes me wonder. Is there a way to understand the programming of the mind and decode it? can we use the complex micro-expressions and the electrical impulses to understand what we are thinking and share it.

Micro-expressions(events that lead to the micro expressions) lead to macro-emotions.

## Change the example to its concept

I am not sure why, but it has to do with me actively trying to suppress the emotional side of me from surfacing.

The other thing about trusting people, its like getting a car, its a lot of investment and honestly the choice has to be perfect. If anything goes wrong, we actually lose a lot of time and effort. If we made the wrong choice and have chosen a person who isn't right for us we have to live with that decision.
